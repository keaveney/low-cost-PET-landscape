# PHOTODETECTORS

## MOVE AWAY FROM PMT
Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMTs) were the main choice for photodetectors before SiPMs [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
This is because of their [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]:

- high gain
- low noise
- fast response time

SiPMs began to be the favorable over PMTs because of their [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]:

- fragility
- large volumes
- high operating voltage
- sensitivity to magnetic fields

## SIPMS

SiPMs are made up of an array of SPADs. The amount of SPADs that are triggered creates a current signal that is proportional to the amount of scintillation light that hit the SiPM. However, if there is more scintillation photons than SPADs then the proportionality of the output current is lost [@enlow_state---art_2023]

### BENEFITS OVER PMTs

- More compact [@enlow_state---art_2023]
    - one-to-one coupling with scintillator pixels increases light collection while maintaining spatial resolution [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024;@daube-witherspoon_scanner_2021;@daube-witherspoon_scanner_2021]
    - increases geometric freedom
- Insensitive to magnetic fields [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024;@enlow_state---art_2023]
- High gains equivalent to PMTs [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
- High detection efficiency [@daube-witherspoon_scanner_2021]
- Relatively low cost [@daube-witherspoon_scanner_2021]
