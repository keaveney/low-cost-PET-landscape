# PHOTODETECTORS

## MOVE AWAY FROM PMT
Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMTs) were the main choice for photodetectors before SiPMs [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
This is because of thier [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]:
- high gain
- low noise
- fast response time
SiPMs began to be the favourable choice because of thier [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]:
- fragility
- large volumes
- high operating voltage
- sensitivity to magnetic fields

## SIPMS

### HOW DO THEY WORK

### COMMERCIAL VS CUSOM ARRAYS

### SIZE

### COUPLING RATIO
