# TIME OF FLIGHT

The location of the annnihilation event along teh LOR has some uncertainty $\Delta * x$ that is dependent on the timing resolution $\Delta * t$ [@enlow_state_art_2023].

$$
\Delta * X = \frac{c * \Delta * t}{2}
$$

If $\Delta * t$ is significantly small enough then one can reduce the location of the annihilation event to a gaussian curve.

TOF information reduces length of each LOR to a more accurate estimation of the annihilation events position.This is effectively reducing the amount of noise in the line of responses which increases the SNR. Increasing the SNR increases the effective sensitivity of the detector [@daube-witherspoon_scanner_2021].


The relative improvement in SNR when comparing TOFPET and normal PET is described with the following equation [@enlow_state_art_2023]:

$$
\frac{SNR_{TOF}}{SNR_{PET}} = \sqrt{2D}{c\Delta*t}
$$

This means that 

Improving the timing resolution of a detector also reduces the number of random events as it allows for a tighter coincidence window [@daube-witherspoon_scanner_2021]. This becomes increasingly important for smaller diameter rings. 

Improving the timing resolution improved how well true coincident events can be identified of a detector increases SNR [@enlow_state_art_2023]
