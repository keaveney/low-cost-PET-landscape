# SCINTILLATION MATERIAL


## TYPE
A good scintillator is one with a high atomic number, high density, high light yield and fast decay time [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]. These qualities of the scintllation material affects the sensitivity, scatter fraction, temporal resolution, energy resolution and temporal resolution of the detector.

### BGO
- Previouslly most commonly used in PET for its high stopping power [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
- Replaced due to its slower decay time and low light yield [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
- TOF not possible [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
