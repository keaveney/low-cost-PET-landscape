# DEPTH OF INTERACTION ENCODING

## BASIC PRINCIPLES

## DOUBLE SIDED READOUT
Monolithic or pixelated material with SiPMs coupled to 2 Opposite ends of the scintillation material [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]. Reflective materials are placed on the sides not coupled to SiPMs in the pixellated arrays [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]. The DOI position is calculated from teh difference in light collected ar either end of the pixels [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]. The monolithic array gives better DOI resolution [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024] but suffers from complex algorithms and calibration processes. 

Double sided readout has been shown to improve timing resolution [@enlow_state_art_2023].

## SINGLE SIDED READOUT

### Pixelated

The use of Anger logic to decode the pixel of interaction as well as extract DOI information is a cost effective method but increases teh pixel decoding error [@yoshida_pet_2024-1].
