# PHOTODETECTORS

## MOVE AWAY FROM PMT
Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMTs) were the main choice for photodetectors before SiPMs [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
This is because of their [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]:

- high gain
- low noise
- fast response time

SiPMs began to be the favourable choice because of their [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]:

- fragility
- large volumes
- high operating voltage
- sensitivity to magnetic fields

## SIPMS

### BENEFITS OVER PMTs

- More compact
    - one-to-one coupling with scintillator pixels increases light collection while maintaining spatial resolution [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
    - increases geometric freedom
- Insensitive to magnetic fields [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
- High gains equivalent to PMTs [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]


### HOW DO THEY WORK

### COMMERCIAL VS CUSTOM ARRAYS
