#### Pixelated Arrays
Most detectors are made with long thin pixellated scintillators coupled to photodetectors at their extremities [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]. All the pixels are optically seperated using some reflective material [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024].

#### Disadvantages

- variation in scintillation light collection efficency [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
- variations in light transmit time to detector [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
- light undergoes various reflections within scintillator array [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
- increases parallax effects [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
These disadvantages can be mitigated by optimizing reflector and lateral surface finishes of scintillator pixels [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]

##### Coupling Ratio
The typical approach is to have a one-to-one ratio between the number of SiPMs and scintillator pixels. Meaning that each SiPM reads the light from a single scintillator pixel. Some design take teh approach of coupling more than one scintillator pixel to a single SiPM [@pizzichemi_new_2016;@wang_development_2022;@wang_evaluation_2021;@zatcepin_improving_2020-1;@pizzichemi_light_2019]. The relative signals in surrounding SiPMs are used to find the center of the light distribution and determine the crystal involved in the detection [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024].
