# SENSITIVITY

SNR in pet is proportional to square root the number of events [@enlow_state_art_2023]

$$
SNR \propto \sqrt{\text{Number_of_Events}}
$$

The number of events $n$ [@enlow_state_art_2023]:

$$
n = kAG(\varepsilon^2)T
$$

# ENERGY RESOLUTION

- photons have a high likelihood of scattering in humans
- a high energy resolution means that the detector will be better at distinguishing true events and scattered events [@enlow_state_art_2023]
- this enhances image contrast
