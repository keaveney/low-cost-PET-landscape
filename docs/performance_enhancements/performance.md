# SENSITIVITY

SNR in pet is proportional to square root the number of events [@enlow_state_art_2023]

$$
SNR \propto \sqrt{Number of Events}
$$

The number of events $n$:

$$
n = k*A*G*(\varepsilon^2)*T [@enlow_state_art_2023]
$$

n = kAGe^2*T [@enlow_state_art_2023]
- $A$ = activity in the FoV
- $G$ = geometric coverage
- $T$ = acquisition time
- $e$ = efficiency of the detector for detecting 511 keV photons
- $k$ = patient specific parameters

# ENERGY RESOLUTION

photons have a high likelihood of scattering in
