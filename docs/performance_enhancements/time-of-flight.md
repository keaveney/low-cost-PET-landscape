TOF information reduces length of each LOR to a more accurate estimation of the annihilation events position.This is effectively reducing the amount of noise in the line of responses which increases the SNR. Increasing the SNR increases the effective sensitivity of the detector [@daube-witherspoon_scanner_2021].

Improving the timing resolution of a detector also reduces the number of random events as it allows for a tighter coincidence window [@daube-witherspoon_scanner_2021]. This becomes increasingly important for smaller diameter rings. 

Improving the timing resolution improved how well true coincident events can be identified of a detector increases SNR [@enlow_state---art_2023]
