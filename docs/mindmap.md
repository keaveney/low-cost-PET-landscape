# Low-cost PET design considerations

## Upfront cost factors
- Detector Size
    - Specialised/Paedetric PET
    - Solid-angle coverage per unit scintillator volume
    - Parallax errors for small PET detectors
- Choice of scintillator material
- Volume of scintillator material
    - Z-spread, shallow layers and photon detection efficiency
- Number of readout channels
    - row-column multiplexing
- Choice of DAQ hardware 
    - specialised ASICs vs. generic FPGAs

## Operating cost factors
- Scanning time & Minimum dose
    - Photon detection efficiency
