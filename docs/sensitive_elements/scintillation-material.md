# SCINTILLATION MATERIAL


## TYPE
A good scintillator is one with a high atomic number, high density, high light yield and fast decay time [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]. These qualities of the scintillation material affects the sensitivity, scatter fraction, temporal resolution, energy resolution and temporal resolution of the detector.

### BGO
- Previously most commonly used in PET for its high stopping power [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024;@daube-witherspoon_scanner_2021]
- Replaced due to its slower decay time and low light yield [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
- TOF not possible [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
- BGO is a third of the price of LYSO [@daube-witherspoon_scanner_2021]

### LYSO

- New industry standard that has replaced BGO [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024;@daube-witherspoon_scanner_2021]
- Has a high stopping power, good light yield and a significantly faster decay time than BGO [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024;@daube-witherspoon_scanner_2021]
- Energy resolution (10-14%) and a timing resolution of (450-600ps) 
- Biggest downside is it high cost [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]

### LFS

- Being investigated as a replacement for LYSO [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
- Timing resolution of 100ps and energy resolution of 10% [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
- More research needs to be done [@el_ouaridi_detection_2024]
