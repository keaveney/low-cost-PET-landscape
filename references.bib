	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The demand for detectors with a time resolution below 100 ps is at the center of research in different fields, from high energy physics to medical imaging. In recent years, interest has grown in nanomaterials that, benefiting from quantum confinement effects, can feature ultra-fast scintillation kinetics and tunable emission. However, standard characterization methods for scintillation properties–relying on radiation sources with an energy range of several hundreds of {keV}–are not suitable for these materials due to their low stopping power, leading to a slowdown of this R\&amp;D line. We present a new method to characterize the time resolution and light output of scintillating materials, using a soft (0–40 {keV} energy) pulsed X-ray source and optimized high-frequency readout electronics. First, we validated the proposed method using standard scintillators. Then, we also demonstrated the feasibility to measure the time resolution and get an insight into the light output of nanomaterials ({InGaN}/{GaN} multi-quantum well and {CsPbBr}$_{\textrm{3}}$ perovskite). This technique is, therefore, proposed as a fundamental tool for characterization of nanomaterials and, more in general, of materials with low stopping power to better guide their development. Moreover, it opens the way to new applications where fast X-ray detectors are requested, such as time-of-flight X-ray imaging.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Scintillator based radiation detectors readout by {SiPMs} successively break records in their reached time resolution. Nevertheless, new challenges in time of flight positron emission tomography ({TOF}-{PET}) and high energy physics are setting unmatched goals in the 10 ps range. Recently it was shown that high frequency ({HF}) readout of {SiPMs} significantly improves the measured single photon time resolution ({SPTR}), allowing to evaluate the intrinsic performance of large area devices; e.g. {FBK} {NUV}-{HD} {SiPMs} of mm2 area and 40 m single photon avalanche diode ({SPAD}) size achieve 90 ps {FWHM}. In {TOF}-{PET} such readout allows to lower the leading edge detection threshold, so that the fastest photons produced in the crystal can be utilized. This is of utmost importance if a high {SPTR} and prompt Cherenkov light generated by the hot-recoil electron upon 511 {keV} photo-absorption should improve timing. This paper shows that high-frequency bipolar transistor readout of state-of-the-art {SiPMs} coupled to high-performance scintillators can substantially improve the best achievable coincidence time resolution ({CTR}) in {TOF}-{PET}. In this context a {CTR} of 158 3 ps {FWHM} with mm3 {BGO} crystals coupled to {FBK} {SiPMs} is achieved. This faint Cherenkov signal is as well present in standard {LSO} scintillators, which together with low {SPTR} values ({\textless}90 ps {FWHM}) improves the {CTR} of mm3 {LSO}:Ce:Ca coupled to {FBK} {NUV}-{HD} mm2 with 25 m {SPAD} size to 61 2 ps {FWHM} using {HF}-electronics, as compared to 73 2 ps when readout by the {NINO} front-end {ASIC}. When coupling the {LSO}:Ce:Ca crystals to {FBK} {NUV}-{HD} {SiPMs} of mm2 and 40 m {SPAD} size, using {HF}-electronics, a {CTR} of even 58 3 ps for mm3 and 98 3 ps for mm3 is achieved.

              The structural applications of quantum dots ({QDs}) can be artificially realized through the preparation of {QDs}-based structural materials, which have unique characteristics of photoluminescence ({PL}) in response to mechanical deformation,
              via
              the dispersion of quantum dots in various materials, including polymers and plastics. A {QDs}-based composite consisting of {CdSe}@{ZnS} core–shell {QDs} and a bisphenol-A type epoxy resin has been prepared by mixing a solution of {CdSe}@{ZnS} core–shell {QDs} in chloroform with bisphenol-A type epoxy resin and modified amine at room temperature. The tensile deformation of the tensile specimens made from the {QDs}-based composite causes a significant change in the {PL} intensity for large engineering strains, and there is no observable strain-induced shift of the wavelength corresponding to the maximum {PL} intensity. Two major modes are observed for the temporal variation of the {PL} intensity of the {QDs}-based composite coated on {AA} 7009 tensile specimens under cyclic loading and unloading of small strains. One exhibits in-phase characteristics with strain, and the other exhibits antiphase characteristics with strain. The variation of the {PL} intensity of the {QDs}-based composite with tensile strain suggests that there exists strain-dependent photoluminescence, which determines the {PL} characteristics of the {CdSe}@{ZnS} core–shell {QDs} in the bisphenol-A type epoxy under the irradiation of ultraviolet light. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of developing sensitive opto-mechanical devices from {QDs}-based composites.},

Software-based noise reduction mainly improves the contrast between regions by reducing the variation of the acquired image. However, it should be performed under appropriate parameters to reduce discrimination. We propose a method that derives optimal noise-reduction parameters using the multi-scale structural similarity index measure and visual information fidelity, which are metrics for image quality assessment. Simulation and experimental studies demonstrated the viability of the proposed algorithm. The contrast-to-noise ratio value of the denoised reconstruction slice, which was used as the optimal parameter, increased approximately three times compared to that of the low-dose slice while preserving the resolution. The results indicate that the proposed method successfully predicted the parameters according to the noise-reduction algorithm and {PET} system conditions in the sinogram domain. The proposed algorithm should help prevent misdiagnosis and provide standardized medical images for clinical application by performing appropriate noise reduction.},

Plastic scintillators provide an affordable approach to large volume detectors, yet their performance for high-energy gamma radiation is severely limited by the small radiation stopping power inherent to their low atomic number. Although some sensitization attempts with organometallics were made in the 1950s to 1960s, the concomitant decrease in light yield has limited the usefulness of these sensitized detectors. Recently, with new knowledge gained during the rapid development of organic optoelectronics and nanotechnology, there has been a revived interest in the field of heavy element sensitized plastic scintillators. Here, the recent efforts on sensitized plastic scintillators are summarized. Basic scintillator physics is first reviewed. The discussion then focuses on two major thrusts in the field: sensitization with: (1) organometallics and (2) oxide and fluoride nanoparticles. The design rationales and major results are examined in detail, with existing limitations and possible future pathways discussed. Special attention is paid to the underlying energy deposition and transfer processes, as these determine the key performance metrics such as light yield and radioluminescence decay lifetime.},

On the contrary, we review recent advancements in cutting-edge approaches to shape scintillator characteristics via photonic and metamaterial engineering, which are extrinsic and introduce controlled inhomogeneity in the scintillator’s surface or volume. The methods to be discussed include improved light out-coupling using photonic crystal ({PhC}) coating, dielectric architecture modification producing the Purcell effect, and meta-materials engineering based on energy sharing. These approaches help to break traditional bulk scintillators’ limitations, e.g., to deal with poor light extraction efficiency from the material due to a typically large refractive index mismatch or improve timing performance compared to bulk materials.

	abstract = {Recently, nanomaterial-based scintillators are newly emerging technologies for many research fields, including medical imaging, nuclear security, nuclear decommissioning, and astronomical applications, among others. To date, scintillators have played pivotal roles in the development of modern science and technology. Among them, plastic scintillators have a low atomic number and are mainly used for beta-ray measurements owing to their low density, but these types of scintillators can be manufactured not in large sizes but also in various forms with distinct properties and characteristics. However, the plastic scintillator is mainly composed of C, H, O and N, implying that the probability of a photoelectric effect is low. In a gamma-ray nuclide analysis, they are used for time-related measurements given their short luminescence decay times. Generally, inorganic scintillators have relatively good scintillation efficiency rates and resolutions. And there are thus widely used in gamma-ray spectroscopy. Therefore, developing a plastic scintillator with performance capabilities similar to those of an inorganic scintillator would mean that it could be used for detection and monitoring at radiological sites. Many studies have reported improved performance outcomes of plastic scintillators based on nanomaterials, exhibiting high-performance plastic scintillators or flexible film scintillators using graphene, perovskite, and 2D materials. Furthermore, numerous fabrication methods that improve the performance through the doping of nanomaterials on the surface have been introduced. Herein, we provide an in-depth review of the findings pertaining to nanomaterial-based scintillators to gain a better understanding of radiological detection technological applications.},

However, light emission rates from conventional scintillation mechanisms fundamentally limit the achievable time resolution, which is presently at least one order of magnitude slower than required for next-generation detectors. One solution to this challenge is to generate an intense prompt signal in response to ionizing radiation. In this paper, we present colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals ({NCs}) as promising prompt photon sources. We investigate two classes of {NCs}: twodimensional {CdSe} nanoplatelets ({NPLs}) and spherical {CdSe}/{CdS} core/giant shell quantum dots ({GS} {QDs}). We demonstrate that the emission rates of these {NCs} under pulsed X-ray excitation are much faster than traditional mechanisms in bulk scintillators, i.e. 5d-4f transitions. {CdSe} {NPLs} have a sub-100 ps eﬀective decay time of 77 ps and {CdSe}/{CdS} {GS} {QDs} exhibit a sub-ns value of 849 ps. Further, the respective {CdSe} {NPL} and {CdSe}/{CdS} {GS} {QD} X-ray excited photoluminescence have the emission characteristics of excitons (X) and multiexcitons ({MX}), with the {MXs} providing additional prospects for fast timing with substantially shorter lifetimes.},

The unique synthetic method combines hot injection with successive injection of precursors in one pot. Transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) shows that {CSS} {QDs} were 6 ± 2 nm in diameter. The elemental composition, determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, was 3.3\% cadmium, 8.6\% selenium, 42.3\% sulfur, and 45.8\% zinc by mole. Photoluminescence spectroscopy ({PL}) showed that the {PL} quantum yield is increased from 0.9\% for {CdSe} to 25\% for {CSS}. Global fitting was used for the analysis of exciton dynamics for {CdSe}, {CdSe}/{ZnS} core/shell, and {CSS} {QDs}. The decays of the {PL} spectra for {CdSe} and {CdSe}/{ZnS} were fit with triple exponentials with lifetimes of 0.7, 8, and 30 ns and 0.7, 10, and 30 ns respectively, while the {CSS} spectrum was fit with a double exponential with lifetimes of 12 and 30 ns. We attribute the 0.7 ns component to nonradiative recombination through dangling bonds at the {CdSe} surface or at crystal lattice dislocations at the {CdSe}/{ZnS} interface. This study clearly demonstrates that the {CSS} approach can be used to substantially improve the optical properties of {QDs} desired for various applications.},

However, current commercial detectors are either prohibitively expensive for wide deployment or incapable of producing the characteristic gamma photopeak. Here we report the synthesis of transparent, ultra-high-loading (up to 60 wt \%) {CdxZn}1–{xS}/{ZnS} core/shell quantum dot/polymer nanocomposite monoliths for gamma scintillation by in situ copolymerization of the partially methacrylate-functionalized quantum dots in a monomer solution. The efficient Förster resonance energy transfer of the high-atomic-number quantum dots to lower-band-gap organic dyes enables the extraction of quantum-dot-borne excitons for photon production, resolving the problem of severe light yield deterioration found in previous nanoparticle-loaded scintillators. As a result, the nanocomposite scintillator exhibited simultaneous improvements in both light yield (visible photons produced per {MeV} of gamma-photon energy) and gamma attenuation. With these enhancements, a 662 {keV} Cs-137 gamma photopeak with 9.8\% resolution has been detected using a 60 wt \% quantum-dot nanocomposite scintillator, demonstrating the potential of such a nanocomposite system in the development of high-performance low-cost spectroscopic gamma detectors.},

Both the core and shell have a wurtzite crystal structure, yielding epitaxial growth of the shell and nearly defect-free crystals. As a result, the photoluminescence ({PL}) quantum efficiency ({QE}) is as high as 90\%. Quantitative {PL} measurements at various excitation wavelengths allow us to separate the nonradiative decay into contributions from interface and surface trapping, giving us pathways for future optimization of the structure. In addition, the {NCs} do not blink, and the giant shell and concurring strong electron delocalization efficiently suppress Auger recombination, yielding a biexciton lifetime of about 15 ns. The corresponding biexciton {PL} {QE} equals 11\% in 5.5/18.1 nm {CdSe}/{CdS}. Variable-temperature time-resolved {PL} and {PL} under magnetic fields further reveal that the emission at cryogenic temperature originates from a negative trion-state, in agreement with other {CdSe}/{CdS} giant-shell systems reported in the literature.},

The prepared {NCs} exhibit strong band edge emission with high photoluminescent quantum yield ({PL} {QY}, up to 80\%) and narrow spectral bandwidth (fwhm {\textless} 25 nm), which is believed to originate from the successful growth of {ZnS} shell layers on the Cd1−{xZnxS} cores and the interfacial compatibility between Cd1−{xZnxS} cores and the {ZnS} shell layers through the intradiffusion of Zn atoms from the {ZnS} shells into the Cd1−{xZnxS} cores during the shell formation reaction. The emission wavelength ({PL} λmax.) of Cd1−{xZnxS}/{ZnS} core/shell {NCs} was finely tuned from violet (415 nm) to blue (461 nm) by adjusting the amount of S precursors in the first injection (S in 1-octadecene) and thus changing actual Cd content ratio in the alloyed Cd1−{xZnxS} cores (0.49 ≤ x ≤ 0.76). Furthermore, multigram (3 g) scale production of Cd1−{xZnxS}/{ZnS} core/shell {NCs} with narrow size distribution and spectral bandwidth was also demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Lead halide perovskite quantum dots ({QDs}) with color tunability and narrow-band emissions are promising materials of nanophotonic and photoelectronic fields, but the lead toxicity and instability limit their practical applications. On the other hand, lead-free perovskite {QDs} suffer from the disadvantages of low photoluminescence quantum yields ({PLQYs}) and poor stability. Here, we demonstrate a green and facile method to synthesize a lead-free perovskite of Cs3Bi2Br9 {QDs} with greatly improved optical properties and stability. With the introduction of Ag ions, the {PLQY} of the as-synthesized Cs3Bi2Br9 {QDs} has been enhanced by 3.93 times, showing a blue emission at 413 nm. We suggest that the introduced Ag(I) complex fixes the bromide on the Cs3Bi2Br9 {QD} surface, reduces the surface trap density, and thus efficiently passivates the surface. This passivation effect also regulates the exciton recombination process and leads to the increased probability of radiative deactivation. {TEM} and {XPS} analyses confirm the existence of Ag atoms on the surface of Cs3Bi2Br9 {QDs}. Moreover, the effective passivation also improves the photostability of Cs3Bi2Br9 {QDs}, resulting in 90\% {PL} intensity being retained after 80 min of {UV} illumination under ambient conditions. We believe that the method used here provides an effective strategy to improve the fluorescence efficiency of lead-free perovskite {QDs}, which will create opportunities for their applications in lighting and displays.},

All {QDs} presently used to generate {TADPL} in {QD}/molecule constructs contain toxic metals including Cd({II}) and Pb({II}), ultimately limiting potential real-world applications. Here, we report newly conceived blue-emitting {TADPL}-producing nanomaterials featuring {InP} {QDs} interfaced with 1- and 2-naphthoic acid (1-{NA} and 2-{NA}) ligands. These constitutional isomers feature similar triplet energies but disparate triplet lifetimes, translating into {InP}-based {TADPL} processes displaying two distinct average lifetime ranges upon cooling from 293 to 193 K. The time constants fall between 4.4 and 59.2 μs in the 2-{NA}-decorated {InP} {QDs} while further expanding between 84.2 and 733.2 μs in the corresponding 1-{NA}-ligated {InP} materials, representing a 167-fold time window. The resulting long-lived excited states enabled facile bimolecular triplet sensitization of 1O2 phosphorescence in the near-{IR} and promoted sensitized triplet–triplet annihilation photochemistry in 2,5-diphenyloxazole. We speculate that the discovery of new nanomaterials exhibiting {TADPL} lies on the horizon as myriad {QDs} can be readily derivatized using isomers of numerous classes of surface-anchoring chromophores yielding precisely regulated photophysical properties.},

However, the current most efficient synthesis method involves a challenging and hazardous step: injecting water-based hydrofluoric acid treatment under high-temperature conditions. Herein, a novel approach utilizing inorganic fluoride {NH}4F as a molecular additive is introduced to simplify the synthesis of highly efficient {ZnSeTe}/{ZnSe}/{ZnS} blue {QDs}. The resulting {QDs} exhibit tunable photoluminescence ({PL}) wavelengths in the pure blue region with near-unit {PL} quantum yield ({QY}). Notably, the use of {NH}4F passivates the {ZnSeTe} cores, enhancing stability and facilitating high-quality coating of the subsequent shell layer, ultimately reducing nonradiative recombination rates and improving {PL} {QY}. To evaluate the practical application of these blue {ZnSeTe}/{ZnSe}/{ZnS} {QDs}, we utilized them as an emitting layer to fabricate {QLEDs} with two typical structures. The results demonstrated that the external quantum efficiency of the standard {QLED} and inverted {QLED} can reach 17.2\% and 16.3\%, respectively, showing comparable performance to {QLEDs} with {QDs} prepared through classical {HF} addition synthesis steps. This environmentally friendly synthesis strategy for pure blue {ZnSeTe} {QDs} with high {PL} {QY} through {NH}4F assistance is expected to offer insights for synthesizing other environmentally friendly {QDs}, thus facilitating the development of eco-friendly {QLEDs}.},

We have synthesized monodisperse colloidal nanocubes (4–15 nm edge lengths) of fully inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites ({CsPbX}3, X = Cl, Br, and I or mixed halide systems Cl/Br and Br/I) using inexpensive commercial precursors. Through compositional modulations and quantum size-effects, the bandgap energies and emission spectra are readily tunable over the entire visible spectral region of 410–700 nm.

Here, we exploit the principle of 511 {keV} energy sharing between a high-Z, high stopping power bulk scintillator, and a nano-scintillator with sub-1 ns radiative recombination times, aiming at a breakthrough in the combined energy and time resolution performance. This proof-of-concept test opens the way to the design and study of larger size sensors using thin nanocomposite layers able to perform as efficient time taggers in a sampling detector geometry of new generation.},

          , 
            Blue quantum dot ({QD}) light emitting diode ({QLED}) developments are far lagging behind the red and green ones as it becomes difficult to balance charge injection and photo stability than the latter. Here, we introduced a combination of a low band energy shell with better surfactants, which largely meet both abovementioned requirements. Our simulation pinpoints that it is the exposed Se on the {QD} surface, which causes non-radiative relaxations. By adding tributyl phosphine ({TBP}), which is a good ligand to Se, we recover photoluminescence quantum yield ({PLQY}) from less than 8.0\% up to above 85.0\%. The corresponding external quantum efficiency ({EQE}) of {QLEDs} increases from 3.1\% to 10.1\%. This demonstrates that the low bandgap shell with effective surfactant passivation is a promising strategy to enhance {QLED} performance.},

These scintillators show much-needed scintillation efficiency along with advantages such as high thermal and radiation stability, less-toxicity, non-hygroscopicity, emissions in the visible range and small decay time etc. Further, in quantum confinement regime, they show improvement in luminescent properties and size dependent emissions. In this review article, the attempt has been made to trace the progress of {ZnSe} based materials towards highly efficient quantum dot scintillators. Here, the fundamental process of scintillation has been explained. Factors such as doping, annealing, heavy ion irradiation which affects the scintillation response of {ZnSe} based scintillators have also been discussed. Method of synthesis plays a key role in optimization of quantum dot properties. Hence, it has been tried to trace the development in methods of synthesis of quantum dots.

Here, we elucidate optimization of the thickness of high-performance plastic scintillator using high atomic number material. Moreover, the {EJ}-200 of commercial plastic scintillators with the same thickness was compared. Two computational simulation codes ({MCNP}, {GEANT}4) were used for thickness optimization and were compared with experimental results to verify data obtained by computational simulation. From the obtained results, it was confirmed that the difference in total counts was less than 10\% in the thickness of the scintillator of 50 mm or more, which means optimized thickness for high efficiency gamma-ray detection such as radioactive 137Cs and 60CO. Finally, simulated results, along with experimental data, were discussed in this study. The results of this study can be used as basic data for optimizing the thickness of plastic scintillators using high atomic number elements for radiation detection and monitoring.},

When the {QDs} were fully dried, simple pellet architectures were manually pressed and I-V sweeps were performed to determine material resistivity. By varying {QD} diameters and ligand combinations the pressed pellet resistivity could be tuned between 104–1013Ω cm. When exposing devices to 133Ba radiation, full energy deposition peaks in pulse height spectra proved difficult to obtain. Sensitivity to the radiation could be ascertained once material resistivity reached ≥108 Ω cm. Several devices demonstrated that resolution (peak full width half max over peak centroid) at 81 {keV} could be achieved with values of 4.75\% and 5.98\%.

These are the lack of an automated means for the optimization of advanced image reconstruction algorithms, and the computational expense associated with these state-of-the art methods. We thus present a novel end-to-end {PET} image reconstruction technique, called {DeepPET}, based on a deep convolutional encoder–decoder network, which takes {PET} sinogram data as input and directly and quickly outputs high quality, quantitative {PET} images. Using simulated data derived from a whole-body digital phantom, we randomly sampled the configurable parameters to generate realistic images, which were each augmented to a total of more than 291,000 reference images. Realistic {PET} acquisitions of these images were simulated, resulting in noisy sinogram data, used for training, validation, and testing the {DeepPET} network. We demonstrated that {DeepPET} generates higher quality images compared to conventional techniques, in terms of relative root mean squared error (11\%/53\% lower than ordered subset expectation maximization ({OSEM})/filtered back-projection ({FBP}), structural similarity index (1\%/11\% higher than {OSEM}/{FBP}), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (1.1/3.8 {dB} higher than {OSEM}/{FBP}). In addition, we show that {DeepPET} reconstructs images 108 and 3 times faster than {OSEM} and {FBP}, respectively. Finally, {DeepPET} was successfully applied to real clinical data. This study shows that an end-to-end encoder–decoder network can produce high quality {PET} images at a fraction of the time compared to conventional methods.},

In this study, Ce3+:Gd3Al3Ga2O12 scintillation ceramics were prepared by the one-step sintering of commercially available Gd2O3, Al2O3, Ga2O3, and {CeO}2 powders in a flowing oxygen atmosphere at 1600 °C by solid-phase reaction sintering. For all the Ce3+:Gd3Al3Ga2O12 ceramic samples doped with different amounts of Ce3+ doping, dense ceramics were obtained. The structure, photoluminescence, and scintillation properties of the Ce3+:Gd3Al3Ga2O12 ceramics have been investigated. The average grain size of samples sintered at 1600 °C is about 2 μm. The X-ray excitation luminescence peak is around 560 nm, which is consistent with that of Ce3+:Gd3Al3Ga2O12 single crystals, matching well with the computed tomography X-ray detector’s response sensitivity. The light yield is higher compared to the standard reference sample—lutetium yttrium orthosilicate single crystal.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI}) has recently attracted much attention for its potential use in healthcare applications. The use of {AI} to improve and extract more information out of medical images, given their parallels with natural images and the immense progress in the area of computer vision, has been at the forefront of these advances. This is due to a convergence of factors, including the increasing numbers of scans performed, the availability of open source {AI} tools, and decreases in the costs of hardware required to implement these technologies. In this article, we review the progress in the use of {AI} toward optimizing {PET}/{CT} and {PET}/{MRI} studies. These two methods, which combine molecular information with structural and (in the case of {MRI}) functional imaging, are extremely valuable for a wide range of clinical indications. They are also tremendously data-rich modalities and as such are highly amenable to data-driven technologies such as {AI}. The first half of the article will focus on methods to improve {PET} reconstruction and image quality, which has multiple benefits including faster image acquisition, image reconstruction, and lower or even “zero” radiation dose imaging. It will also address the value of {AI}-driven methods to perform {MR}-based attenuation correction. The second half will address how some of these advances can be used to perform to optimize diagnosis from the acquired images, with examples given for whole-body oncology, cardiology, and neurology indications. Overall, it is likely that the use of {AI} will markedly improve both the quality and safety of {PET}/{CT} and {PET}/{MRI} as well as enhance our ability to interpret the scans and follow lesions over time. This will hopefully lead to expanded clinical use cases for these valuable technologies leading to better patient care.},

	abstract = {Plastic scintillators have received strong interest as an important type of radiation sensing material due to their relatively high light output, fast decay time, low fabrication cost, excellent durability, and most importantly, the capability to be shaped into desired forms through the use of molds or other approaches. However, the interior sensitivity and energy resolution of traditional plastic scintillators limit their competitiveness when compared with their inorganic counterparts. The doping of quantum dots ({QDs}) with high-Z element into plastic scintillators has recently been demonstrated as an effective way to improve gamma stopping power and scintillation efficiency. In this regard, a series of research activities have been conducted to address the aggregation and self-absorption problem of {QDs} to achieve high-performance transparent plastic scintillators with a high concentration of {QDs} load. Here we present a comprehensive review to offer a timely reference source to accelerate the development of this exciting research area. This review covers the description of basic theory, the summary of recent experimental progress, and the discussion of future trends of {QD}-doped nanocomposite plastic scintillators.},

	abstract = {Parallax error is a common issue in high-resolution preclinical positron emission tomography ({PET}) scanners as well as in clinical scanners that have a long axial field of view ({FOV}), which increases estimation uncertainty of the annihilation position and therefore degrades the spatial resolution. A way to address this issue is depth-of-interaction ({DOI}) estimation. In this work we propose two machine learning-based algorithms, a dense and a convolutional neural network ({NN}), as well as a multiple linear regression ({MLR})-based method to estimate {DOI} in depolished {PET} detector arrays with single-sided readout. The algorithms were tested on an 8× 8 array of 1.53× 1.53× 15 mm3 crystals and a 4× 4 array of 3.1× 3.1× 15 mm3 crystals, both made of Ce:{LYSO} scintillators and coupled to a 4× 4 array of 3× 3 mm3 silicon photomultipliers ({SiPMs}). Using the conventional linear {DOI} estimation method resulted in an average {DOI} resolution of 3.76 mm and 3.51 mm {FWHM} for the 8× 8 and the 4× 4 arrays, respectively. Application of {MLR} outperformed the conventional method with average {DOI} resolutions of 3.25 mm and 3.33 mm {FWHM}, respectively. Using the machine learning approaches further improved the {DOI} resolution, to an average {DOI} resolution of 2.99 mm and 3.14 mm {FWHM}, respectively, and additionally improved the uniformity of the {DOI} resolution in both arrays. Lastly, preliminary results obtained by using only a section of the crystal array for training showed that the {NN}-based methods could be used to reduce the number of calibration steps required for each detector array.},

	abstract = {High-resolution arrays of discrete monocrystalline scintillators used for gamma photon coincidence detection in {PET} are costly and complex to fabricate, and exhibit intrinsically non-uniform sensitivity with respect to emission angle. Nanocomposites and transparent ceramics are two alternative classes of scintillator materials which can be formed into large monolithic structures, and which, when coupled to optical photodetector arrays, may offer a pathway to low cost, high-sensitivity, high-resolution {PET}. However, due to their high optical attenuation and scattering relative to monocrystalline scintillators, these materials exhibit an inherent trade-off between detection sensitivity and the number of scintillation photons which reach the optical photodetectors. In this work, a method for optimising scintillator thickness to maximise the probability of locating the point of interaction of 511 {keV} photons in a monolithic scintillator within a specified error bound is proposed and evaluated for five nanocomposite materials ({LaBr}3:Ce-polystyrene, Gd2O3-polyvinyl toluene, {LaF}3:Ce-polystyrene, {LaF}3:Ce-oleic acid and {YAG}:Ce-polystyrene) and four ceramics ({GAGG}:Ce, {GLuGAG}:Ce, {GYGAG}:Ce and {LuAG}:Pr). {LaF}3:Ce-polystyrene and {GLuGAG}:Ce were the best-performing nanocomposite and ceramic materials, respectively, with maximum sensitivities of 48.8\% and 67.8\% for 5 mm localisation accuracy with scintillator thicknesses of 42.6 mm and 27.5 mm, respectively.},

Brain {PET} cameras with restricted field of view to a smaller size to cover the brain can both exhibit significantly higher performance and lower the cost when compared to conventional whole-body {PET} scanners. The existing designs based on scintillation crystals employ the most commonly known materials such as lutetium oxyorthosilicate and bismuth germanate. This is due to their relatively good parameters such as high light yield and density. The main drawback of using scintillation crystals is that they have a modest energy resolution. In this study, a brain {PET} scanner was designed and simulated using a Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission ({GATE}) toolkit. The performances of five crystals, namely strontium hafnate, gadolinium aluminium gallium garnet, gadolinium yttrium gallium aluminium garnet, gadolinium lutetium gallium aluminium garnet, and lutetium oxyorthosilicate for comparison, were evaluated in terms of sensitivity, spatial resolution, and count rate. The performance evaluation results showed that among the suggested scintillators, strontium hafnate can be considered as a promising alternative detector for high performance brain {PET} systems.},

            The imaging performance of clinical positron emission tomography ({PET}) systems has evolved impressively during the last ∼15 years.

At the same time, it appears unlikely that a system-level {CRT} in the order of ∼10 ps can be reached with conventional scintillation detectors. Such a {CRT} could eliminate the need for conventional tomographic image reconstruction and a search for new approaches to timestamp annihilation photons with ultra-high precision is therefore warranted.

	abstract = {Objective. In {PET}/{CT} imaging, {CT} is used for positron emission tomography ({PET}) attenuation correction ({AC}). {CT} artifacts or misalignment between {PET} and {CT} can cause {AC} artifacts and quantification errors in {PET}. Simultaneous reconstruction ({MLAA}) of {PET} activity (λ-{MLAA}) and attenuation (μ-{MLAA}) maps was proposed to solve those issues using the time-of-flight {PET} raw data only. However, λ-{MLAA} still suffers from quantification error as compared to reconstruction using the gold-standard {CT}-based attenuation map (μ-{CT}). Recently, a deep learning ({DL})-based framework was proposed to improve {MLAA} by predicting μ-{DL} from λ-{MLAA} and μ-{MLAA} using an image domain loss function ({IM}-loss). However, {IM}-loss does not directly measure the {AC} errors according to the {PET} attenuation physics. Our preliminary studies showed that an additional physics-based loss function can lead to more accurate {PET} {AC}. The main objective of this study is to optimize the attenuation map generation framework for clinical full-dose 18F-{FDG} studies. We also investigate the effectiveness of the optimized network on predicting attenuation maps for synthetic low-dose oncological {PET} studies. Approach. We optimized the proposed {DL} framework by applying different preprocessing steps and hyperparameter optimization, including patch size, weights of the loss terms and number of angles in the projection-domain loss term. The optimization was performed based on 100 skull-to-toe 18F-{FDG} {PET}/{CT} scans with minimal misalignment. The optimized framework was further evaluated on 85 clinical full-dose neck-to-thigh 18F-{FDG} cancer datasets as well as synthetic low-dose studies with only 10\% of the full-dose raw data. Main results. Clinical evaluation of tumor quantification as well as physics-based figure-of-merit metric evaluation validated the promising performance of our proposed method. For both full-dose and low-dose studies, the proposed framework achieved {\textless}1\% error in tumor standardized uptake value measures. Significance. It is of great clinical interest to achieve {CT}-less {PET} reconstruction, especially for low-dose {PET} studies.},

Repeatability and reproducibility are two essential requirements for any quantitative measurement and/or imaging biomarker. Repeatability relates to the uncertainty in obtaining the same result in the same patient when he or she is examined more than once on the same system. However, imaging biomarkers should also have adequate reproducibility, i.e. the ability to yield the same result in the same patient when that patient is examined on different systems and at different imaging sites. Adequate repeatability and reproducibility are essential for the clinical management of patients and the use of {FDG} {PET}/{CT} within multicentre trials. A common standardised imaging procedure will help promote the appropriate use of {FDG} {PET}/{CT} imaging and increase the value of publications and, therefore, their contribution to evidence-based medicine. Moreover, consistency in numerical values between platforms and institutes that acquire the data will potentially enhance the role of semiquantitative and quantitative image interpretation. Precision and accuracy are additionally important as {FDG} {PET}/{CT} is used to evaluate tumour response as well as for diagnosis, prognosis and staging. Therefore both the previous and these new guidelines specifically aim to achieve standardised uptake value harmonisation in multicentre settings.},

	abstract = {Background
According to the World Health Organization ({WHO}), non-communicable diseases are responsible for 71\% of annual global mortality. National governments and international organizations are increasingly considering medical imaging and nuclear medicine access data in strategies to address epidemiologic priorities. Our objective here was to develop a statistical model to assist countries in estimating their needs for {PET}-{CT} systems for the management of specific cancer types.

Material/Methods
We introduce a patient-centered statistical model based on country-specific epidemiological data, {PET}-{CT} performance, and evidence-based clinical guidelines for {PET}-{CT} use for cancer. The output of the model was integrated into a Bayesian model to rank countries or world regions that would benefit the most from upscaling {PET}-{CT} scanners.

Results
We applied our model to the {IMAGINE} database, recently developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency ({IAEA}). Our model indicates that at least 96 countries should upscale their {PET}-{CT} services and more than 200 additional {PET}-{CT} scanners would be required to fulfill their needs. The model also provides quantitative evidence indicating that low-income countries would benefit the most from increasing {PET}-{CT} provision. Finally, we discuss several cases in which the standard unit [number of scanners]/[million inhabitants] to guide strategic planning or address inequities is misleading.

Conclusions
Our model may help in the accurate delineation and further reduction of global inequities in access to {PET}-{CT} scanners. As a template, the model also has the potential to estimate the costs and socioeconomic impact of implementing any medical imaging modality for any clinical application.},

The combined acquisition of {PET} and {CT} has synergistic advantages over {PET} or {CT} alone and minimizes their individual limitations. It is a valuable tool for staging and restaging of some tumors and has an important role in the detection of recurrence in asymptomatic patients with rising tumor marker levels and patients with negative or equivocal findings on conventional imaging techniques. It also allows for monitoring response to therapy and permitting timely modification of therapeutic regimens. In about 27\% of the patients, the course of managment is changed.

	abstract = {Nowadays, attention is growing on the Silicon Photomultipliers ({SiPMs}) detector for many applications, especially in nuclear medicine research. Currently, timing performance in Positron Emission Tomography ({PET}) detector plays a significant role in image reconstruction. This work mainly aims at the processing of timing signal for a better timing performance. We applied a timing detector with a 3×3×10 mm3 {LYSO} crystal directly coupled with a large-size {SensL} {SiPM} with a sensitive area of 6×6 mm2. The standard output of the {SiPM} was used for energy calculations while the fast output was for timing pickoff. Three different readout configurations for fast timing signals were used for timing performance evaluation: 1) the recommended {RF} transformer-based readout, 2) the cascaded Common Emitter Amplifier ({CEA}), 3) the commercial {RF} amplifier. The best {FWHM} {CTR} values for the three were 228.3 ± 1.4 ps, 235.4 ± 1.1 ps and 231.1 ± 1.5 ps for the {RF} transformer-based, the {CEA}-based and the {RF} amplifier-based readout configurations respectively. Experiment results show that schemes based on the {CEA}-based and the {RF} amplifier-based configuration have a better uniformity with different trigger thresholds, which is better for practical multi-channel readout electronics system.},

In these types of materials, quantum confinement of electron-hole pairs and coherent exciton states play a significant role in enhancing the dipole moment of the absorption and emission transitions. Thus they provide a sub-1 ns radiative decay component, critical to improve state-of-the-art time resolution of current bulk classical scintillators. However, the efficiency of this fast emission processes have not been determined so far in terms of number of photons emitted per energy deposited in the {keV} range. In this contribution, we propose several methods to determine the light yield of different nano-scintillating structures in order to understand their potential as radiation detectors for fast timing applications. These methods have been implemented using samples of a broad spectrum regarding synthesis, fabrication and preparation methods as well as registered scintillation efficiency, using both X-ray and electron excitation.},

	abstract = {The emergence of new solid-state avalanche photodetectors, e.g. {SiPMs}, with unprecedented timing capabilities opens new ways to profit from ultrafast and prompt photon emission in scintillators. In time of flight positron emission tomography ({TOF}-{PET}) and high energy timing detectors based on scintillators the ultimate coincidence time resolution ({CTR}) achievable is proportional to the square root of the scintillation rise time, decay time and the reciprocal light yield, 𝐶𝑇 𝑅 ∝ √𝜏𝑟𝜏𝑑 ∕𝐿𝑌 . Hence, the precise study of light emission in the very first tens of picoseconds is indispensable to understand time resolution limitations imposed by the scintillator. We developed a time correlated single photon counting setup having a Gaussian impulse response function ({IRF}) of 63ps sigma, allowing to precisely measure the scintillation rise time of various materials with 511keV excitation. In L(Y){SO}:Ce we found two rise time components, the first below the resolution of our setup {\textless}10 ps and a second component being ∼380 ps. Co-doping with Ca2+ completely suppresses the slow rise component leading to a very fast initial scintillation emission with a rise time of {\textless}10ps. A very similar behavior is observed in {LGSO}:Ce crystals. The results are further confirmed by complementary measurements using a streak-camera system with pulsed X-ray excitation and additional 511 {keV} excited measurements of Mg2+ co-doped {LuAG}:Ce, {YAG}:Ce and {GAGG}:Ce samples.},

	abstract = {Silicon photomultipliers ({SiPMs}), owing to their low-level photon counting capabilities, have increased in popularity in the field of high energy astrophysics, particle physics and medical imaging. It is crucial to accurately characterise {SiPMs} so they can be optimised for a particular application such as the Compact High Energy Camera ({CHEC}-S) for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes ({IACT}). Extraction techniques, applied to {SiPMs}, can quantify opto-electrical parameters such as gain, quenching resistance, junction, parasitic and grid capacitance, rise time constant and slow and fast fall time constants. Various authors have applied and compared different extraction techniques to {SiPMs}, usually based on the Laplace Transform in the s-domain of the equivalent circuit model. These techniques typically utilise the pulse tail, and therefore only parameterise the recharge phase of the pulse. We will improve upon existing methods by utilising the discharge phase of an {SiPM} pulse in our transfer function model. In this paper, we have also applied this method to present the electrical characterisation of a novel {SiPM} detector: Hamamatsu {LVR}3 S14520-6075. The paper also details a method by which an accurate, average pulse shape, uncontaminated by after-pulsing or dark noise, can be obtained. This is a prerequisite for our analysis method, which fits the pulse shape derived from the transfer function of the {SiPM} model to the experimental data.},

	abstract = {The silicon-photomultiplier ({SiPM}) is becoming the device of choice for different applications, for example in fast timing like in time of flight positron emission tomography ({TOF}-{PET}) and in high energy physics ({HEP}). It is also becoming a choice in many single-photon or few-photon based applications, like for spectroscopy, quantum experiments and distance measurements ({LIDAR}). In order to fully benefit from the good performance of the {SiPM}, in particular its sensitivity, the dynamic range and its intrinsically fast timing properties it is necessary to understand, quantitatively describe and simulate the various parameters concerned. These analyses consider the structure and the electrical model of a single photon avalanche diode ({SPAD}), i.e. the {SiPM} microcell, and the integration in an array, i.e. the {SiPM}. Additionally, for several applications a more phenomenological and complete view on {SiPMs} has to be done, e.g. photon detection efficiency, single photon time resolution, {SiPM} signal response, gain fluctuation, dark count rate, afterpulse, prompt and delayed optical crosstalk. These quantities of {SiPMs} can strongly influence the time and energy resolution, for example in {PET} and {HEP}. Having a complete overview on all of these parameters allows to draw conclusions on how best performances can be achieved for the various needs of different applications.},

Compared to 3 × 3 × 2 mm3 sized single crystal Ce:{GAGG}, the translucent ceramic Ce:{GAGG}, which has a much lower transmittance than the single crystal, was determined to give an output signal amplitude that is approximately 61\% of single crystal Ce:{GAGG}.

On the other hand, the coincidence resolving time ({CRT}) of ceramic Ce:{GAGG} was 307 ± 23 ps, better than the 465 ± 37 ps acquired with single crystals—probably attributed to its slightly faster decay time and higher proportion of the fast decay component. The ceramic Ce:{GAGG} may be a promising cost-effective candidate for applications that do not require thick scintillators such as x-ray detectors and charged particle detectors, and those that require time-of-flight capabilities.},

	abstract = {Breakthrough energy resolution, R(662keV) {\textless}4\%, has been achieved with an oxide scintillator, Cerium-doped Gadolinium Yttrium Gallium Aluminum Garnet, or {GYGAG}(Ce), by optimizing fabrication conditions. Transparent ceramic Ceriumdoped Gadolinium Garnet, {GYGAG}(Ce), has a peak emission wavelength of 550 nm that is better matched to Silicon photodetectors than to standard {PMTs}. We have therefore designed a spectrometer based on pixelated {GYGAG}(Ce) on a Silicon photodiode array that can provide R(662 {keV}) =3.5\%. In comparison, with large 1-2 in3 size {GYGAG}(Ce) ceramics we obtain R(662 {keV}) =4.6\% with {PMT} readout. We find that ceramic {GYGAG}(Ce) of a given stoichiometric chemical composition can exhibit very different scintillation properties, depending on sintering conditions and post-anneal treatments. Oxide scintillators tend to exhibit multiple scintillation decay components, including some very slow components, classified as “afterglow,” and related to shallow traps, thought to be predominantly due to oxygen vacancies. Among the characteristics of transparent ceramic garnet scintillators that can be controlled by fabrication conditions are: scintillation decay component amplitudes, intensity and duration of afterglow, thermoluminescence glow curve peak positions and amplitudes, integrated light yield, light yield non-proportionality, as measured in the Scintillator Light Yield Non-Proportionality Characterization Instrument ({SLYNCI}), and energy resolution for gamma spectroscopy. Garnet samples exhibiting a significant fraction of Cerium dopant is in the tetravalent valence also exhibit: faster overall scintillation decay, very low afterglow, high light yield, but poor light yield proportionality and degraded energy resolution.},

In this paper, a highly integrated readout electronic system was designed and implemented based on a self-developed {FESA} (Front End for {SiPM} Arrays) readout {ASIC}; a compact cost-effective detector module with four lined up detector heads was built, and its performance was evaluated. Each detector head consisted of a 24× 24 {LYSO} crystal array (each crystal element had dimensions of 0.99 × 0.99 × 15 mm3), one end coupling to an 8 × 8 silicon photomultiplier array ({SiPM} array with dimensions of 3.2 × 3.2 mm2 each), and the other end covered with a 1 mm thick light guide layer. Since the front-end {FESA} readout chip employed a row-column summing circuit to reduce the readout channels from 64 to 16, we tried a new depth encoding method based on a single-end readout with the structure. The test results showed that the average coincidence time resolution ({CTR}), energy resolution, and depth of interaction ({DOI}) resolution of the detector are 413 ps, 15.7\%, and 5.2 mm, respectively, while the crystal array in the detector head with 9-to-1 coupling can be clearly separated in the flood image. Compared with the detector head without the depth encoding ability, the clearness of the flood image was slightly decreased, but the energy resolution and time performance remained the same. We also implemented a central control board that connected all detector modules via fiber connections. The data from the detector modules could be collected over the connections, and the system central clock could be precisely distributed; therefore, the compactness of the electronics system was further enhanced.},

Detectors utilized in these scanners have finer pixel size with depth of interaction ({DOI}) capability. This work presents a {LYSO}(Ce) detector module with {DOI} capability which has the potential to be scaled up to a high-resolution small animal or organ-dedicated {PET} system. For {DOI} capability, a submodule with one {LYSO} block detector utilizing {PETsys} {TOFPET}2 application-specific integrated circuit ({ASIC}) was previously developed in our lab. We scaled up the submodule and optimized the configuration to allow for a compact housing of the dual-readout boards in one side of the blocks by designing a high-speed dual-readout cable to maintain the original pin-to-pin relationship between the Samtec connectors. The module size is 53.8 × 57.8 mm2. Each module has 2 × 2 {LYSO} blocks, each {LYSO} block consists of 4 × 4 {LYSO} units, and each {LYSO} unit contains a 6 × 6 array of 1 × 1 × 20 mm3 {LYSO} crystals. The four lateral surfaces of {LYSO} crystal were mechanically ground to W14, and the two end surfaces were polished.

Introduction: Our group previously developed a {PET} system using a single-ended continuous depth-of-interaction ({cDOI}) estimation method based on a single-layer pixelated crystal array optically coupled to digital {SiPM} and triangular teeth-shaped reflector strips (Phys Med Biol 2017;465-483). However, the lack of commercially available digital {SiPMs} has led us to investigate a multiplexing scheme for {cDOI} detector modules based on analog {SiPM} arrays. The multiplexing scheme was developed to obtain 2-dimensional light dispersion information while allowing a remarkably high channel reduction ratio.
Methods: The {SiPM} readout circuit was designed to instantaneously compute the first and second momentums of the light dispersion. A modified symmetric charge division ({SCD}) network was constructed by feeding the symmetrically divided output current from each {SiPM} anodes into a 1-dimensional charge division circuit (1D-{CDC}). Each node voltage of 1D-{CDC} was then summed so that the output voltage is quadratically position-encoded. The injected charge distribution was analytically derived (2003 {IEEE} {NSS} 2003; 2169-2173) enabling {DOI} value to be encoded as a difference between x- and y- directional signal variations. {GATE} Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate the feasibility of the multiplexing scheme on the {cDOI} detector module. The contribution of the non-uniform gain distribution of the {SiPM} array was considered by randomly weighting 64 anode signals with Gaussian distribution (μ = 1, σ = 0 - 0.5). To determine the circuit parameter, we estimated {DOI} resolution while the {SCD} network resistor ({RL}) and 1D-{CDC} chain resistor ({RD}) values varied from 1 {kΩ} to 10 {kΩ} and 5 Ω to 100 Ω, respectively. To examine the detector performance dependence on crystal-to-{SiPM} coupling ratio and crystal aspect ratio, we tested various arrays of {LSO} crystals with different cross-sectional areas (2.0 × 2.0 mm2, 1.5 × 1.5 mm2, and 1.2 × 1.2 mm2) which correspond to crystal-to-channel multiplexing ratio of 24:1, 42.7:1, and 66.7:1. We conducted crystal identification by applying a density-based clustering method on 3D histogram of interaction positions obtained with continuously encoded {DOI}. A non-tagging {DOI} calibration method with head-on irradiation based on the encoded {DOI} histogram, which is more practical than commonly used side-tagging method, was applied.
Results: The designed circuit allowed the derivation of {DOI} information from the x- and y- directional light dispersion with only 6 readout channels. Increased gain variation resulted in the slight degradation of {DOI} resolution but still remained below 3 mm until the standard deviation of gain reached 0.5. The {DOI} resolution improved as the {RL}/{RD} ratio increased mainly because the high {RL}/{RD} ratio reduces leakage current and helps the 1D-{CDC} resistor chain to function properly as a linear voltage divider. The crystals were clearly resolved in flood maps with average k-parameters higher than 5.5 in all crystal dimensions. Average {DOI} resolution was degraded as the crystal-to-{SiPM} coupling ratio increased with fixed crystal length. In crystals with the same aspect ratio, smaller crystals provided better {DOI} performance. Average {DOI} resolution of 2.68 ± 0.37 mm {FWHM} was obtained with 2.0 × 2.0 × 20 mm3 crystals showing no degradation comparing to typical {SCD} method. The density-based clustering method allowed effective crystal pixel identification while rejecting unwanted background events. Non-tagging {DOI} calibration was successfully performed with good agreement with the side-tagging method thanks to the well-identified event clusters.
Conclusions: The multiplexing scheme based on a modified {SCD} network that allows encoding of second-order statistics of light dispersion and practically applicable {DOI} calibration method seems to be promising for continuous {DOI} estimation with only a small number of {SiPM} readout channels. The proposed method will be useful in reducing the complexity of the readout electronics for high-performance {DOI} {PET} systems.{\textless}img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Figure" src="https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/jnumed/63/supplement\_2/3317/F1.medium.gif" width="440" height="247"/{\textgreater}Download {figureOpen} in new {tabDownload} powerpoint},

	abstract = {We present the first experimental evaluation of a depth-of-interaction ({DOI}) positron emission tomography ({PET}) detector using a digital silicon photomultiplier ({dSiPM}). To measure {DOI} information from a mono-layer array of scintillation crystals with a single-ended readout, our group has previously proposed and developed a new method based on light spread using triangular reflectors. Since this method relies on measurement of the light distribution, {dSiPM}, which has a fully digital interface, has several merits for our {DOI} measurement. The {DOI} {PET} detector comprised of a {dSiPM} sensor ({DPC}-3200-22-44) coupled with a 14 × 14 array of 2 mm × 2 mm × 20 mm unpolished {LGSO} crystals. All crystals were covered with triangular reflectors. To obtain a good performance of the {DOI} {PET} detector, several parameters of detector were selected as a preliminary experiment. Detector performance was evaluated with the selected parameters and the optimal experimental setup, and a {DOI} measurement was conducted by irradiating the crystal block at five {DOI} positions spaced at intervals of 4 mm. Maximum-likelihood estimation was employed for {DOI} positioning and the optimal {DOI} estimation scheme was also investigated in this study. As a result, the {DOI} {PET} detector showed clear crystal identification. The energy resolution (full-width at half-maximum ({FWHM})) averaged over all depths was 10.21\% ± 0.15\% at 511 {keV}, and time resolution averaged over all depths was 1198.61 ± 39.70 ps {FWHM}. The average {DOI} positioning accuracy for all depths was 74.22\% ± 6.77\%, which equates to {DOI} resolution of 4.67 mm. Energy and {DOI} resolutions were uniform over all crystal positions except for the back parts of the array. Furthermore, additional simulation studies were conducted to verify the results of our {DOI} measurement method that is combined with {dSiPM} technology. In conclusion, our continuous {DOI} {PET} detector coupled with {dSiPM} is a promising {PET}/{MRI} detector with {DOI}-encoding capability.},

	abstract = {Parallax error is a common issue in high-resolution preclinical positron emission tomography ({PET}) scanners as well as in clinical scanners that have a long axial field of view ({FOV}), which increases estimation uncertainty of the annihilation position and therefore degrades the spatial resolution. A way to address this issue is depth-of-interaction ({DOI}) estimation. In this work we propose two machine learning-based algorithms, a dense and a convolutional neural network ({NN}), as well as a multiple linear regression ({MLR})-based method to estimate {DOI} in depolished {PET} detector arrays with single-sided readout. The algorithms were tested on an 8× 8 array of 1.53× 1.53× 15 mm3 crystals and a 4× 4 array of 3.1× 3.1× 15 mm3 crystals, both made of Ce:{LYSO} scintillators and coupled to a 4× 4 array of 3× 3 mm3 silicon photomultipliers ({SiPMs}). Using the conventional linear {DOI} estimation method resulted in an average {DOI} resolution of 3.76 mm and 3.51 mm {FWHM} for the 8× 8 and the 4× 4 arrays, respectively. Application of {MLR} outperformed the conventional method with average {DOI} resolutions of 3.25 mm and 3.33 mm {FWHM}, respectively. Using the machine learning approaches further improved the {DOI} resolution, to an average {DOI} resolution of 2.99 mm and 3.14 mm {FWHM}, respectively, and additionally improved the uniformity of the {DOI} resolution in both arrays. Lastly, preliminary results obtained by using only a section of the crystal array for training showed that the {NN}-based methods could be used to reduce the number of calibration steps required for each detector array.},

	abstract = {In small animal and organ dedicated {PET} scanners, the knowledge of depth of interaction ({DOI}) of the gamma ray along the main axis of the scintillator is a fundamental information in order to avoid parallax error and to achieve high performances in terms of spatial resolution. Recently we developed a new method to obtain the {DOI} function for a single side readout {PET} module, recirculating the scintillation light in the matrix by means of a mirror placed on top of the module. In a complete {PET} scanner, periodical {DOI} calibrations have to be performed to prevent time dependent miscalibrations and performance degradations. The current {DOI} calibration relies on a coincidence system between the module and an external scintillator to provide a priori the {DOI} information and it is clearly not feasible in a real system without unpractical disassemblies of the scanner. In this paper we develop instead a fast and precise calibration method based on uniform irradiation of the scintillators. Three irradiation modalities are presented, in particular one where the source is placed on top of the module, one with the source placed on one side of the module and one that exploits the internal radioactivity of the scintillator. The three different procedures are evaluated and the calibration method is validated by comparing the information provided by the coincidence setup.},

	abstract = {This is a design and Monte Carlo ({MC}) study of a practical entire torso {PET} ({PET}-{PET}) with 1-meter axial field-of-view ({AFOV}) for imaging the head-\&-torso simultaneously. Our studies show that {PET}-{PET} would image the entire body in 2-3 minutes with a 3-4 {mCi} {FDG} injected dose, which would reduce whole-body cancer-imaging cost and the low dose may justify its use for cancer screening. It can capture dynamic whole-body time-activity and arterial input from the heart/aorta to create quantitative metabolic rate-constant images of the entire body. It uses low-cost {BGO} crystals with/without depth-of-interaction ({DOI}) detection. In the {DOI} implementations, a sparse quadrant-sharing {SiPM} readout design is used to reduce {SiPM} related cost, thus enabling the cost to approach that of current clinical {PET} with {LYSO} in a 25-cm {AFOV}. The Dichotomous Offset-Quadrant-Sharing ({DO}-{QS}) {DOI} detector design has a crystal-to-{SiPM} ratio of 2:1; it has unique crystal-column decoding (X-Y) without analog-decoding errors. The {DOI} detector would improve the transaxial radial resolution and may also improve the axial resolution. The non-{DOI} detector design uses 4 {SiPM} (3-mm) at the four corners of a 5×5 (6×6) {BGO} array to achieve a crystal-to-{SiPM} ratio of 6.25:1 (9:1); it uses mirror film of difference sizes and shapes between crystals to distribute scintillation light for analog crystal decoding. For the {DO}-{QS} {DOI} detector design, {MC} studies showed {DOI} resolution of 5 mm with each 3.24×3.24×20 mm3 {BGO} pixel columns divided into 4-layers along the 20-mm depth; the time resolution ({FWHM}) is 1.6 ns. Resolution and {NES} were estimated with {MC} simulations for point sources and extended whole-body Turkington phantom (extended to 80-cm in axial length), which showed the transaxial resolution to be 2.8 to 3.3 mm ({DO}-{QS}). The {NES} result showed 2-3 minutes whole-body imaging with 3-4 {mCi} {FDG} injection would be comparable to current clinical {PET} with 10-{mCi} injection and 20-min imaging.},

	abstract = {The detection of depth-of-interaction ({DOI}) is a critical detector capability to improve the {PET} spatial resolution uniformity across the field-of-view and will significantly enhance, in particular, small bore system performance for brain, breast, and small animal imaging. One promising technique of {DOI} detection is to use dual-ended-scintillator readout that uses two photon sensors to detect scintillation light from both ends of a scintillator array and estimate {DOI} based on the ratio of signals (similar to Anger logic). This approach needs a careful {DOI} function calibration to establish accurate relationship between {DOI} and signal ratios, and to recalibrate if the detection condition is shifted due to the drift of sensor gain, bias variations, or degraded optical coupling, etc. However, the current calibration method that uses coincident events to locate interaction positions inside a single scintillator crystal has severe drawbacks, such as complicated setup, long and repetitive measurements, and being prone to errors from various possible misalignments among the source and detector components. This method is also not practically suitable to calibrate multiple {DOI} functions of a crystal array. To solve these problems, a new method has been developed that requires only a uniform flood source to irradiate a crystal array without the need to locate the interaction positions, and calculates {DOI} functions based solely on the uniform probability distribution of interactions over {DOI} positions without knowledge or assumption of detector responses. Simulation and experiment have been studied to validate the new method, and the results show that the new method, with a simple setup and one single measurement, can provide consistent and accurate {DOI} functions for the entire array of multiple scintillator crystals. This will enable an accurate, simple, and practical {DOI} function calibration for the {PET} detectors based on the design of dual-ended-scintillator readout. In addition, the new method can be generally applied to calibrating other types of detectors that use the similar dual-ended readout to acquire the radiation interaction position.},

Experiments were performed using an 8 {\textbackslash}times 8 (crystal size: 4 mm {\textbackslash}times 4 mm {\textbackslash}times 15 mm) and a 12 {\textbackslash}times 12 (crystal size: 2.65 mm {\textbackslash}times 2.65 mm {\textbackslash}times 15 mm) segmented {LYSO} crystals coupled with an 8 {\textbackslash}times 8 {SiPM} (J-series, from {ON} Semiconductor) array which is under 22Na point source excitation. Initial test results indicate that the energy resolution of the two detectors after correction is around 13.2\% and 13.5\% at 511 {keV}, and the profiles of the flood histograms show a clear visualization of the discrete scintillator element. All measurements were carried out at room temperature ( 25°C), without additional cooling.},

	abstract = {Modern {PET} detectors rely on fast and accurate timing performances in order to provide improved lesion detectability and reduced patient scan times. Optimizing the coincidence timing resolution ({CTR}) is an important facet that helps achieve high {PET} detector performance. On the way of improving the {CTR} to sub-100 ps, and ultimately to 10 ps, research on all detector components is necessary, including the scintillator, photodetector and electronic readout. The digital {SiPM}, where each single photon avalanche diode ({SPAD}) is connected to its own readout, has gained a lot of attention as the ultimate photodetector. However, extended power consumption and the enormous number of channels makes the realization challenging. Hence, in this contribution we investigate a semidigital approach, realized with the pixelation of an analog {SiPM}. We tested a single {SiPM} from {HPK} (S13360-6075V) compared to a 2x2 {SiPM} array (S13361-3075N-02) and a 3x3 {SiPM} array (S13361-2075N-03) with a 6x6x3 mm3 crystal and a 6x6x20 mm3 crystal, readout by our in-house developed acquisition system employing {NINO} as front-end {ASIC}. Preliminary results show that the single {SiPM} array routinely performed better than the pixelated arrays while reading each of the individual {SiPMs} independently, correcting for time walk and properly combining the time-stamps. A minimum {CTR} value of 117 ± 53ps wascrystal achieved using the single {SiPM} array with the 6x6x3 mm for the {NINO} electronics readout. Using a {HF} bipolar transistor readout, a similar trend was observed, with a minimum {CTR} of 116 ± 5 ps for the single array and the 6x6x3 mm3crystal. A-priori this result is surprising because, due to the lower capacitance of the smaller {SiPMs}, electronic noise should be reduced leading to better timing. The most probable explanation for this counter-intuitive result is the 4 or 9 times lower number of scintillation photons generating each {SiPM} signal, which together with correlated noise sources (optical cross-talk) leads to excess noise, especially in the applied leading edge time discrimination.},

	abstract = {Recently, we reported a hybrid positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging ({PET}-{MRI}) approach involving the transmission of a photo-sensor charge signal to a preamplifier using a long cable. However, in this application, pulse distortions may degrade the performance of the {PET} detector. The purpose of this study is to further extend the charge signal transmission ({CST}) approach and to design a {PET} detector module capable of transmitting the photo-sensor charge signal to {PET} electronics remotely located outside the {MRI} room for the hybrid {PET}-{MRI}. To achieve this, we developed a pulse restoration circuit ({PRC}) compensating the performance degradations caused by using the long cable from Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode ({GAPD}) to {PET} electronics. The effect of the cable length on the {PET} detector performance was examined using different lengths of flexible flat cable ranging from 0 to 21 m. Rise time, fall time and amplitude of the {GAPD} output were measured as a function of the cable length. Photopeak position, energy resolution and time resolution were also measured using a 100 {MS}/s data acquisition unit. {PRC} based on the filtering and shaping networks consisted of amplitude, and rise and fall restorations. The amplitude restoration was designed using op-amp and resistors. The rise time-fall time restoration was designed using {RC} shaping filter. The measured pulse shapes passing through the long cable with {PRC} were similar to the output of {GAPD} with the cable length of 0 m (amplitude 169 {mV}, rise time 35 ns and fall time 210 ns), and the degrading {PET} detector performance caused by long cable were restored (energy resolution 16\%, photopeak position 400 ch and time resolution 1.3 ns). There were no significant changes in the {PET} detector module performance using the {CST} approach with {PRC} as a function of the cable length, both outside and inside the {MRI} room. There were no obvious artifacts or changes in the {MR} phantom images. These results show that the proposed approach using extended charge signal transmission method with long cable and simple pulse restoration circuit is reliable and useful for the development of a hybrid {PET}-{MRI} system.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A new positron emission tomography ({PET}) detector signal processing method, the charge signal transmission approach, is proposed for the development of a hybrid {PET}-magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}). A number of experiments were performed to demonstrate that the Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode ({GAPD}) charge output could be transmitted to a preamplifier using a long cable without degrading the {PET} signal performance. Methods: A {PET} module consisted of {LYSO} and a {GAPD} with a array. The {GAPD} output was transmitted to the preamplifier through flexible flat cables. The effect of the cable length on the {PET} performance was examined using seven different lengths ranging from 10 to 300 cm outside and inside the 7 T animal {MRI}. Four parameters (rise time, fall time, amplitude, and area of the preamplifier output) were measured as a function of the cable length using a 10 {GS}/s oscilloscope and three parameters (photopeak position, energy resolution, and time resolution) were measured using a 100 {MS}/s {DAQ} unit. The effect of the cable length on the {MR} phantom images was investigated. In addition, the effect of the {PET} module configuration on its temperature stability was assessed by acquiring the energy and time spectra. Results: There were no significant changes in the {PET} module performance as a function of the cable length, both outside and inside {MRI}. The performance changes in energy information, such as the amplitude, area, photopeak position, and energy resolution, were with cable lengths ranging from 10 to 300 cm and the change in the time resolution was . There were no obvious artifacts or changes in the line profile in the {MR} phantom images. Moreover, no manifest changes in the photopeak position and coincidence counting rate were observed in the {PET} modules employing the charge signal transmission approach, whereas considerable degradation of the {PET} module performance was observed in the voltage signal transmission approach. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that it is feasible to design a hybrid {PET}-{MRI} using the charge signal transmission approach, which is expected to have more advantages than other approaches.},

	abstract = {A monolithic crystal-based positron emission tomography ({PET}) detector has a low cost and high sensitivity and allows determining 3D positions by scintillation light distribution. However, the edge effect inherent to scintillators deteriorates the position resolution of the detector toward the crystal borders due to the escape and reflection of the scintillation light. An increase in crystal thickness will improve the detection efficiency, but the edge effect becomes severe. To improve the position resolution and detection efficiency of scintillators, the light-sharing technique is developed. Two identical trapezoidal monolithic cerium-doped lutetium yttrium orthosilicate ({LYSO}) crystals with a bottom size of 25.80 × 25.80 mm2 and a thickness of 20 mm are optically coupled at one lateral face by an optical medium. The scintillation light near the optically coupled interface is jointly collected by two adjacent 8 × 8 {SiPM} arrays from the bottom faces. The {SiPM} signals are individually read out and processed by using the multichannel readout application-specific integrated circuits ({ASICs}) of {TOFPET}2 to provide a light distribution. The transverse positions and depth of interaction ({DOI}) are calculated from the measured light distribution. As expected, the optical glue with a refractive index of 𝑛 = 1.68 shows better light sharing between two {LYSO} crystals than the coupling media of silicon grease (𝑛 = 1.40) and air. For the 20 mm thick monolithic {LYSO}-based {PET} detector, the transverse position resolution near the crystal edge is improved by nearly 30\% by using the light-sharing method compared with the black-painted treatment. However, the {DOI} resolution near the edge of the crystal is not significantly improved, which may be attributed to the incomplete collection of scintillation light. The {DOI} resolution of the detector would be improved by using electronics with lower noise and {SiPM} arrays with smaller pixel.},

	abstract = {In recent years, silicon photomultiplier ({SiPM}) is replacing the photomultiplier tube ({PMT}) in positron emission tomography ({PET}) systems due to its superior properties, such as fast single-photon timing response, small gap between adjacent photosensitive pixels in the array, and insensitivity to magnetic fields. One of the technical challenges when developing {SiPM}-based {PET} systems or other position-sensitive radiation detectors is the large number of output channels coming from the {SiPM} array. Therefore, various signal multiplexing methods have been proposed to reduce the number of output channels and the load on the subsequent data acquisition ({DAQ}) system. However, the large {PN}-junction capacitance and quenching resistance of the {SiPM} yield undesirable resistance–capacitance delay when multiple {SiPMs} are combined, which subsequently causes the accumulation of dark counts and signal fluctuation of {SiPMs}. Therefore, without proper {SiPM} signal handling and processing, the {SiPMs} may yield worse timing characteristics than the {PMTs}. This article reviews the evolution of signal readout and multiplexing methods for the {SiPM}. In this review, we focus primarily on analog electronics for {SiPM} signal multiplexing, which allows for the reduction of {DAQ} channels required for the {SiPM}-based position-sensitive detectors used in {PET} and other radiation detector systems. Although the applications of most technologies described in the article are not limited to {PET} systems, the review highlights efforts to improve the physical performance (e.g. spatial, energy, and timing resolutions) of {PET} detectors and systems.},

For example, whole-body Positron Emission Tomography ({PET}) systems are typically composed of thousands of scintillation crystal elements, which are coupled to photosensors. Thus, {PET} systems greatly benefit from methods to reduce the number of data acquisition channels, in order to reduce the system development cost and complexity. In this paper we present an electrical delay line multiplexing scheme that can significantly reduce the number of readout channels, while preserving the signal integrity required for good time resolution performance. We experimented with two 4 × 4 {LYSO} crystal arrays, with crystal elements having 3 mm × 3 mm × 5 mm and 3 mm × 3 mm × 20 mm dimensions, coupled to 16 Hamamatsu {MPPC} S10931-050P {SiPM} elements. Results show that each crystal could be accurately identified, even in the presence of scintillation light sharing and inter-crystal Compton scatter among neighboring crystal elements. The multiplexing configuration degraded the coincidence timing resolution from ∼243 ps {FWHM} to ∼272 ps {FWHM} when 16 {SiPM} signals were combined into a single channel for the 4 × 4 {LYSO} crystal array with 3 mm × 3 mm × 20 mm crystal element dimensions, in coincidence with a 3 mm × 3 mm × 5 mm {LYSO} crystal pixel. The method is flexible to allow multiplexing configurations across different block detectors, and is scalable to an entire ring of detectors.},

	abstract = {Depth-encoding detectors with single-ended readout provide a practical, cost-effective approach for constructing high-resolution and high-sensitivity {PET} scanners. However, the current iteration of such detectors uses a uniform glass light-guide to achieve depth encoding, resulting in nonuniform performance throughout the detector array due to suboptimal intercrystal light sharing. We introduce Prism-{PET}, a single-ended-readout {PET} detector module with a segmented light-guide composed of an array of prismatoids that introduce enhanced, deterministic light sharing. Methods: High-resolution {PET} detector modules were fabricated with single-ended readout of polished multicrystal lutetium yttrium orthosilicate scintillator arrays directly coupled 4-to-1 and 9-to-1 to arrays of 3 × 3 mm silicon photomultiplier pixels. Each scintillator array was coupled at the nonreadout side to a light-guide (one 4-to-1 module with a uniform glass light-guide, one 4-to-1 Prism-{PET} module, and one 9-to-1 Prism-{PET} module) to introduce intercrystal light sharing, which closely mimics the behavior of dual-ended readout, with the additional benefit of improved crystal identification. Flood histogram data were acquired using a 3-{MBq} 22Na source to characterize crystal identification and energy resolution. Lead collimation was used to acquire data at specific depths to determine depth-of-interaction ({DOI}) resolution. Results: The flood histogram measurements showed excellent and uniform crystal separation throughout the Prism-{PET} modules, whereas the uniform glass light-guide module had performance degradation at the edges and corners. A {DOI} resolution of 5.0 mm full width at half maximum ({FWHM}) and an energy resolution of 13\% {FWHM} were obtained in the uniform glass light-guide module. By comparison, the 4-to-1 coupled Prism-{PET} module achieved a {DOI} resolution of 2.5 mm {FWHM} and an energy resolution of 9\% {FWHM}. Conclusion: {PET} scanners based on our Prism-{PET} modules with segmented prismatoid light-guide arrays can achieve high and uniform spatial resolution (9-to-1 coupling with ∼1-mm crystals), high sensitivity (20-mm-thick detectors and intercrystal Compton scatter recovery), good energy and timing resolutions (using polished crystals and after applying {DOI} correction), and compact size (depth encoding eliminates parallax error and permits smaller ring-diameter).},

	abstract = {The fundamental limits of spatial resolution in positron emission tomography ({PET}) have been understood for many years. The physical size of the detector element usually plays the dominant role in determining resolution, but the combined contributions from acollinearity, positron range, penetration into the detector ring, and decoding errors in the detector modules often combine to be of similar size. In addition, the sampling geometry and statistical noise further degrade the effective resolution. This paper quantitatively describes these effects, discusses potential methods for reducing the magnitude of these effects, and computes the ultimately achievable spatial resolution for clinical and pre-clinical {PET} cameras.},

In this paper, we have developed a compact, lightweight {PET} imaging system that is based on {SiPM} detectors for small animals imaging, which could be integrated into a multi-modality imaging system. This {PET} imaging system consists of a stationary detector gantry, a motor-controlled animal bed module, electronics modules, and power supply modules. The {PET} detector, which was designed as a multi-slice circular ring geometry of 27 discrete block detectors, is composed of a cerium doped lutetium–yttrium oxyorthosilicate ({LYSO}) scintillation crystal and {SiPM} arrays. The system has a 60mm transaxial field of view ({FOV}) and a 26mm axial {FOV}. Performance tests (e.g. spatial resolution, energy resolution, and sensitivity) and phantom and animal imaging studies were performed to evaluate the imaging performance of the {PET} imaging system. The performance tests and animal imaging results demonstrate the feasibility of an animal {PET} system based on {SiPM} detectors and indicate that {SiPM} detectors can be promising photodetectors in animal {PET} instrumentation development.},

	abstract = {Organ-specific {PET} scanners have been developed to provide both high spatial resolution and sensitivity, although the deployment of several dedicated {PET} scanners at the same center is costly and space-consuming. Active-{PET} is a multifunctional {PET} scanner design exploiting the advantages of two different types of detector modules and mechanical arms mechanisms enabling repositioning of the detectors to allow the implementation of different geometries/configurations. Active-{PET} can be used for different applications, including brain, axilla, breast, prostate, whole-body, preclinical and pediatrics imaging, cell tracking, and image guidance for therapy. Monte Carlo techniques were used to simulate a {PET} scanner with two sets of high resolution and high sensitivity pixelated Lutetium Oxyorthoscilicate ({LSO}(Ce)) detector blocks (24 for each group, overall 48 detector modules for each ring), one with large pixel size (4 × 4 mm2) and crystal thickness (20 mm), and another one with small pixel size (2 × 2 mm2) and thickness (10 mm). Each row of detector modules is connected to a linear motor that can displace the detectors forward and backward along the radial axis to achieve variable gantry diameter in order to image the target subject at the optimal/desired resolution and/or sensitivity. At the center of the field-of-view, the highest sensitivity (15.98 kcps {MBq}−1) was achieved by the scanner with a small gantry and high-sensitivity detectors while the best spatial resolution was obtained by the scanner with a small gantry and high-resolution detectors (2.2 mm, 2.3 mm, 2.5 mm {FWHM} for tangential, radial, and axial, respectively). The configuration with large-bore (combination of high-resolution and high-sensitivity detectors) achieved better performance and provided higher image quality compared to the Biograph {mCT} as reflected by the 3D Hoffman brain phantom simulation study. We introduced the concept of a non-static {PET} scanner capable of switching between large and small field-of-view as well as high-resolution and high-sensitivity imaging.},

The {DS}-{PS}3 detector is designed as a high performance, cost-effective {PET} detector for organ-specific imaging systems (e.g., brain, breast, etc.). Methods: Two sparse 4-by-4 arrays of silicon photomultipliers (18.5\% {SiPM} fill factor) coupled through segmented light guide are used to readout a 15-by-15 array of 2-mm-pitch, 20-mm-long {LSYO} crystals. Uniform flood data were used for crystal identification, depth determination, and position-dependent energy resolution. Intrinsic-spatial and depth-of-interaction ({DOI}) resolutions were determined by stepping a collimated gamma-ray source over the front and side, respectively. Results: We measured an average intrinsic spatial resolution of 2.14 ± 0.07 mm full width at half maximum ({FWHM}). {DOI} {FWHM} resolution varied from 2.2 mm for crystals over sensors to 5.3 mm for crystals between sensors. Average {DOI} resolution was 3.6 ± 0.8 mm {FHWM}. Average energy resolution for the detector module was 16.6\% with a range of 11.3\%–25.8\%. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the use of a dual-sided sparse sensor array to enable low-cost high-performance decoding of 3-D positioning within a {PET} detector using an 18.5\% sensor fill factor.},

However, small animal imaging by {PET} has been challenging with respect to spatial resolution and sensitivity due to the small volume of the imaging objects. A {DOI}-encoding technique allows for pre-clinical {PET} to simultaneously achieve high spatial resolution and high sensitivity. Thus many {DOI}-encoding methods have been proposed. In this paper we describe why {DOI} measurements are important, what is required in {DOI}-encoding designs, and how to extract {DOI} information in scintillator-based {DOI} detectors. Recently, there has been a growing interest in {DOI} measurements for {TOF} {PET} detectors to correct time walk as a function of {DOI} position.

	abstract = {Positron emission tomography ({PET}) is a tool for metabolic imaging that has been utilized since the earliest days of nuclear medicine. A key component of such imaging systems is the detector modules—an area of research and development with a long, rich history. Development of detectors for {PET} has often seen the migration of technologies, originally developed for high energy physics experiments, into prototype {PET} detectors. Of the many areas explored, some detector designs go on to be incorporated into prototype scanner systems and a few of these may go on to be seen in commercial scanners. There has been a steady, often very diverse development of prototype detectors, and the pace has accelerated with the increased use of {PET} in clinical studies (currently driven by {PET}/{CT} scanners) and the rapid proliferation of pre-clinical {PET} scanners for academic and commercial research applications. Most of these efforts are focused on scintillator-based detectors, although various alternatives continue to be considered. For example, wire chambers have been investigated many times over the years and more recently various solid-state devices have appeared in {PET} detector designs for very high spatial resolution applications. But even with scintillators, there have been a wide variety of designs and solutions investigated as developers search for solutions that offer very high spatial resolution, fast timing, high sensitivity and are yet cost effective. In this review, we will explore some of the recent developments in the quest for better {PET} detector technology.},

The proposed detector configuration comprises {LGSO} scintillation crystal elements optically coupled to silicon photomultipliers ({SiPMs}) which are read out by a fast, high precision, multi-channel amplifier/comparator integrated circuit ({IC}). Results obtained with that {IC} were compared with those achieved using a high-frequency ({HF}) readout, comprising discrete element readout for each detector channel. {CTR} values of 89.6 ± 0.8 ps and 105.1 ± 0.9 ps {FWHM} were achieved with the {HF} readout for 3 × 3 × 3 mm3 and 3 × 3 × 10 mm3 {LGSO} crystals, respectively, and 92.8 ± 0.9 ps and 114.1 ± 1.1 ps {FWHM} were achieved using the {IC} board for the same crystal elements.

	abstract = {Positron emission tomography ({PET}) is a powerful medical imaging modality used in nuclear medicine to diagnose and monitor various clinical diseases in patients. It is more sensitive and produces a highly quantitative mapping of the three-dimensional biodistribution of positron-emitting radiotracers inside the human body. The underlying technology is constantly evolving, and recent advances in detection instrumentation and {PET} scanner design have significantly improved the medical diagnosis capabilities of this imaging modality, making it more efficient and opening the way to broader, innovative, and promising clinical applications. Some significant achievements related to detection instrumentation include introducing new scintillators and photodetectors as well as developing innovative detector designs and coupling configurations. Other advances in scanner design include moving towards a cylindrical geometry, 3D acquisition mode, and the trend towards a wider axial field of view and a shorter diameter. Further research on {PET} camera instrumentation and design will be required to advance this technology by improving its performance and extending its clinical applications while optimising radiation dose, image acquisition time, and manufacturing cost. This article comprehensively reviews the various parameters of detection instrumentation and {PET} system design. Firstly, an overview of the historical innovation of the {PET} system has been presented, focusing on instrumental technology. Secondly, we have characterised the main performance parameters of current clinical {PET} and detailed recent instrumental innovations and trends that affect these performances and clinical practice. Finally, prospects for this medical imaging modality are presented and discussed. This overview of the {PET} system’s instrumental parameters enables us to draw solid conclusions on achieving the best possible performance for the different needs of different clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Along with the popularization and technological maturation of integrated {PET}-{CT}, the center of research interest has moved to integrated {PET}-{MR}. In this situation, we are developing a multi-modal compatible flexible {PET} scanner. In our concepts, the scanner consists of adjustable two detector units and their support apparatus, and then scans a patient lying on a bed equipped by other medical imaging/non-imaging device. Therefore, depending on the size and shape of the patient and the patient bed and other demands, the detector geometry can be changed flexibly. Although, due to the limited angular coverage, distortion- and artifact-free image reconstruction is not feasible without detector rotation, it is known that accurate time-of-flight ({TOF}) information helps to improve reconstruction quality in such a partial-ring scanner. In this study, we performed whole-body 2-D imaging simulations to investigate detector geometric and {TOF} requirements for the partial-ring scanner for obtaining comparable image quality to a conventional full-ring non-{TOF} scanner. In particular, required angular coverage by the detector units in relation with the timing resolution and the influence of the arrangement of the opposed detector units (i.e., missing direction is perpendicular to patient's front-to-back or left-to-right direction) to the reconstruction image quality were investigated. The simulation results on the image appearance and contrast-noise performance showed that the partial-ring scanner consisting of the two detector arcs each having the central angle of 150 degree and 400-500 ps timing resolution could provide comparable image quality to the conventional scanner regardless of the arrangement of the opposed detectors. However, in the case of the 130 degree coverage with the 400-500 ps timing resolution, the contrast-noise performance of the partial-ring geometries could not reach partially that of the conventional scanner due to the missed spatial and/or statistical information. In this point, we showed that the use of the object support constraint in the iterative reconstruction could reduce the intensity bias and blurring and then improves the contrast-noise performance.},

	abstract = {Current generation of commercial time-of-flight ({TOF}) {PET} scanners utilize 20–25 mm thick {LSO} or {LYSO} crystals and have an axial {FOV} ({AFOV}) in the range of 16–22 mm. Longer {AFOV} scanners would provide increased intrinsic sensitivity and require fewer bed positions for whole-body imaging. Recent simulation work has investigated the sensitivity gains that can be achieved with these long {AFOV} scanners, and has motivated new areas of investigation such as imaging with a very low dose of injected activity as well as providing whole-body dynamic imaging capability in one bed position. In this simulation work we model a 72 cm long scanner and prioritize the detector design choices in terms of timing resolution, crystal size (spatial resolution), crystal thickness (detector sensitivity), and depth-of-interaction ({DOI}) measurement capability. The generated list data are reconstructed with a list-mode {OSEM} algorithm using a Gaussian {TOF} kernel that depends on the timing resolution and blob basis functions for regularization. We use lesion phantoms and clinically relevant metrics for lesion detectability and contrast measurement. The scan time was fixed at 10 min for imaging a 100 cm long object assuming a 50\% overlap between adjacent bed positions. Results show that a 72 cm long scanner can provide a factor of ten reduction in injected activity compared to an identical 18 cm long scanner to get equivalent lesion detectability. While improved timing resolution leads to further gains, using 3 mm (as opposed to 4 mm) wide crystals does not show any significant benefits for lesion detectability. A detector providing 2-level {DOI} information with equal crystal thickness also does not show significant gains. Finally, a 15 mm thick crystal leads to lower lesion detectability than a 20 mm thick crystal when keeping all other detector parameters (crystal width, timing resolution, and {DOI} capability) the same. However, improved timing performance with 15 mm thick crystals can provide similar or better performance than that achieved by a detector using 20 mm thick crystals.},

	abstract = {Maintaining excellent timing resolution in the generation of silicon photomultiplier ({SiPM})-based time-of-flight positron emission tomography ({TOF}-{PET}) systems requires a large number of high-speed, high-bandwidth electronic channels and components. To minimize the cost and complexity of a system’s back-end architecture and data acquisition, many analog signals are often multiplexed to fewer channels using techniques that encode timing, energy, and position information. With progress in the development {SiPMs} having lower dark noise, after pulsing, and cross talk along with higher photodetection efficiency, a coincidence timing resolution ({CTR}) well below 200 ps {FWHM} is now easily achievable in single pixel, bench-top setups using 20-mm length, lutetium-based inorganic scintillators. However, multiplexing the output of many {SiPMs} to a single channel will significantly degrade {CTR} without appropriate signal processing. We test the performance of a {PET} detector readout concept that multiplexes 16 {SiPMs} to two channels. One channel provides timing information with fast comparators, and the second channel encodes both position and energy information in a time-over-threshold-based pulse sequence. This multiplexing readout concept was constructed with discrete components to process signals from a 4×4 array of {SensL} {MicroFC}-30035 {SiPMs} coupled to 2.9×2.9×20  mm3 Lu1.8Gd0.2SiO5 ({LGSO}):Ce (0.025 mol. \%) scintillators. This readout method yielded a calibrated, global energy resolution of 15.3\% {FWHM} at 511 {keV} with a {CTR} of 198±2  ps {FWHM} between the 16-pixel multiplexed detector array and a 2.9×2.9×20  mm3 {LGSO}-{SiPM} reference detector. In summary, results indicate this multiplexing scheme is a scalable readout technique that provides excellent coincidence timing performance.},

	abstract = {Compressed sensing can be used to multiplex a large number of individual readout sensors to significantly reduce the number of readout channels in a large area {PET} block detector. The compressed sensing framework can be used to treat {PET} data acquisition as a sparse readout problem and achieve sub-Nyquist rate sampling, where the Nyquist rate is determined by the pixel pitch of the individual {SiPM} sensors. The sensing matrix is fabricated by using discrete elements or wires that uniquely connect pixels to readout channels. By analyzing the recorded magnitude on several {ADC} channels, the original pixel values can be recovered even though they have been scrambled through a sensing matrix. In a {PET} block detector design comprising 128 {SiPM} pixels arranged in a 16 × 8 array, compressed sensing can provide higher multiplexing ratios (128:16) than Anger logic (128:32) or Cross-strip readout (128:24) schemes while resolving multiple simultaneous hits. Unlike Anger and cross-strip multiplexing, compressed sensing can recover the positions and magnitudes of simultaneous, multiple pixel hits. Decoding multiple pixel hits can be used to improve the positioning of events in light-sharing designs, inter-crystal scatter events, or events that pile up in the detector. A Monte-carlo simulation of a compressed sensing multiplexed circuit design for a 16 × 8 array of {SiPM} pixels was done. Noise sources from the {SiPM} pixel (dark counts) and from the readout channel (thermal noise) were included in the simulation. Also, two different crystal designs were simulated, a 1×1 coupled design with 128 scintillation crystals, and a 3:2 light-sharing design with 196 crystals. With an input {SNR} of 37dB (experimentally measured from a single {SiPM} pixel), all crystals were clearly decoded by the compressed sensing multiplexing with a decoded {SNR} of the sum signal a 30.6 ± 0.1 {dB} {SNR} for the one-to-one coupling, and 26.1 ± 0.1 {dB} three-to-two coupling.

	abstract = {Background:
Given the large number of readout pixels in clinical positron emission tomography ({PET}) scanners, signal multiplexing is an indispensable feature to reduce scanner complexity, power consumption, heat output, and cost.

Purpose:
In this paper, we introduce interleaved multiplexing ({iMux}) scheme that utilizes the characteristic light-sharing pattern of depth-encoding Prism-{PET} detector modules with single-ended readout.

Methods:
The {iMux} scheme shorts anodes from the four nearest neighbor silicon photomultiplier ({SiPM}) pixels that overlap with distinct light guides and connect to the same application-specific integrated circuit ({ASIC}) channel. The 4-to-1 coupled Prism-{PET} detector module was used which consisted of a 16 × 16 array of 1.5 × 1.5 × 20 mm3 lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate ({LYSO}) scintillator crystals coupled to an 8 × 8 array with 3 × 3 mm2 {SiPM} pixels. A deep learning-based demultiplexing model was investigated to recover the encoded energy signals. Two different experiments were performed with non-multiplexed and multiplexed readouts to evaluate the spatial, depth of interaction ({DOI}), and timing resolutions of our proposed {iMux} scheme.

Results:
The measured flood histograms, using the decoded energy signals from our deep learning-based demultiplexing architecture, achieved perfect crystal identification of events, and results were highly consistent with the non-multiplexed energy signals. The average energy, {DOI} and timing resolutions were 9.6 ± 1.5\%, 2.9 ± 0.9 mm, and 266 ± 19 ps for non-multiplexed readout and 10.3 ± 1.6\%, 2.8 ± 0.8 mm, and 311 ± 28 ps for multiplexed readout, respectively.

Conclusions:
Our proposed {iMux} scheme improves on the already cost-effective and high-resolution Prism-{PET} detector module and provides 16-to-1 crystal-to-readout multiplexing without appreciable performance degradation. Also, only 4 {SiPM} pixels are shorted together in the 8 × 8 array to achieve 4-to-1 pixel-to-readout multiplexing, resulting in lower capacitance per multiplexed channel.},

	abstract = {Depth of interaction ({DOI}) decoding capability shows great application potential for positron emission tomography ({PET}), especially for high-resolution small-animal {PET} or long axial field of view {PET} systems. On the basis of {GATE} optical simulation results, we presented a novel 9×9 lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate array with 10-mm rectangular light-sharing windows ({RLSWs}) and assembly the detector with nine crystals coupled to one silicon photomultiplier ({SiPM}) method; this caused {DOI}-related position shifts in the crystal decoding spots of the flood map. Homogeneous radiation was used to establish transfer functions to convert spot shifts into {DOI} measurements. The conventional collimated radiation experiments were used to assess the accuracy of the {DOI} measurements. Flood map results show that 81 segmented crystals can be clearly resolved, including 16 crystals adjacent to two {RLSW} windows (M-type), 40 crystals adjacent to one {RLSW} window (E-type), and 25 crystals not adjacent to any {RLSW} window (C-type). The mean absolute error of all {DOI}-capable crystals, M-type crystals, and E-type crystals are 2.15 ± 0.61, 1.95 ± 0.50, and 2.23 ± 0.63 mm, respectively. The novel nine-crystals-to-one-{SiPM} coupling technology is a low cost approach for constructing high-performance {DOI} detector modules. Detectors using nine-crystals-to-one-{SiPM} coupling technology are good candidates for high-resolution preclinical {PET} and for total-body {PET}.},

	abstract = {A novel concept for a positron emission tomography ({PET}) camera module is proposed, which provides full 3D reconstruction with high resolution over the total detector volume, free of parallax errors. The key components are a matrix of long scintillator crystals and hybrid photon detectors ({HPDs}) with matched segmentation and integrated readout electronics. The {HPDs} read out the two ends of the scintillator package. Both excellent spatial (x, y, z) and energy resolution are obtained. The concept allows enhancing the detection efficiency by reconstructing a significant fraction of events which underwent Compton scattering in the crystals. The proof of concept will first be demonstrated with yttrium orthoaluminate perovskite ({YAP}):Ce crystals, but the final design will rely on other scintillators more adequate for {PET} applications (e.g. {LSO}:Ce or {LaBr}3:Ce). A promising application of the proposed camera module, which is currently under development, is a high resolution 3D brain {PET} camera with an axial field-of-view of ∼15 cm dedicated to brain research. The design philosophy and performance predictions based on analytical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations are presented. Image correction and reconstruction tools required to operate this transmissionless device in a research environment are also discussed. Better or similar performance parameters were obtained compared to other known designs at lower fabrication cost. The axial geometrical concept also seems to be promising for applications such as positron emission mammography.},

	abstract = {{SiPM} has excellent potential as a {TOF}-{PET} detector because of its fast response. One-to-one connecting of a {SiPM} and a fast ({RF}) amplifier is preferable for maximizing timing performance. Custom {ASIC} is one solution to realize it in a compact front-end electronics of a detector, but a huge development cost and a long development time are required. We developed a 64ch {SiPM}-based {TOF}-{PET} detector using {SiPM} multiplexing architecture in which {SiPMs} output signals are multiplexed into one timing signal for reducing timing channels. It causes the degradation of timing resolution due to dark noise and parasitic capacitance of {SiPMs}, but it can be improved by optimizing the parameter of readout circuit. Timing signal is generated by the leading edge discriminator. Position and energy signals are generated by Anger logic calculator and summing circuits with slow (video rate) amplifiers. Each {SiPM} is connected the capacitor for timing signals and resistor matrix for position signals. The proposed circuit makes it possible to read the timing signal and position (and energy) signals simultaneously without interference because of the difference in bandwidth of these signals. The developed detector applies four {SiPM} arrays (S13361-3050NE, 4 × 4 ch of 3 × 3 mm2, Hamamatsu) with a scintillator block consists of 2.1 mm × 2.1 mm × 15 mm {LFS} (Lutetium Fine Silicate, Zecotek) crystal in a 12 × 12 array. The front-end module is composed of two 32ch {SiPM} signals multiplexing circuits with fast amplifiers and discriminators for timing signal. Coincidence timing resolution of the developed detectors was estimated to be 286 ps ({FWHM}), and energy resolution was measured as 13.6 \%. Moreover, all the crystals (12 × 12) were clearly separated on the 2-D position histogram, so the spatial resolution was estimated to be less than 2.3mm. These results suggest that our new detector is practical for {TOF}-{PET}.},

The standard Anger-logic scheme including light sharing (an 8 by 8 crystal array coupled to a 2×2 photodetector array with an optical diffuser, multiplexing ratio: 16:1) has been widely used to address such a challenge. Our work proposes a generalized model to study the impacts of two critical parameters on spatial resolution performance of a {PET} block detector: multiple interaction events and signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}). The study consists of the following three parts: (1) studying light output profile and multiple interactions of 511keV photons within crystal arrays of different crystal widths (from 4mm down to 1mm, constant height: 20mm); (2) applying the Anger-logic positioning algorithm to investigate positioning/decoding uncertainties (i.e., “block effect”) in terms of peak-to-valley ratio ({PVR}), with light sharing, multiple interactions and photodetector {SNR} taken into account; and (3) studying the dependency of spatial resolution on {SNR} in the context of modulation transfer function ({MTF}). The proposed model can be used to guide the development and evaluation of a standard Anger-logic based {PET} block detector including: (1) selecting/optimizing the configuration of crystal elements for a given photodetector {SNR}; and (2) predicting to what extent additional electronic multiplexing may be implemented to further reduce the number of readout channels.},

Such detectors typically rely on some form of analog signal multiplexing in order to minimize the number of readout electronics channels and the positions of the gamma ray interactions are calculated using Center-of-Gravity ({CoG}) method.In this paper we report on the Truncated Center of Gravity ({TCoG}) and Raised To the Power ({RTP}) methods for reconstruction of the positions of the gamma ray interactions as applied to a newly developed small-scale {PET} detector prototype based on 24x24 {LYSO} scintillation crystal arrays and 8x8 {SiPM} arrays. In the current small-scale prototype, the analog signal readout is optimized with 64:16 multiplexing ratio.A notable advantage of using {TCoG} or {RTP} algorithms instead of basic Centre-of-Gravity ({CoG}) is demonstrated. Particularly, the Field of View ({FOV}) distortion inherent to {CoG} reconstruction is eliminated.},

There are several commercially available Si-{PM} arrays with different pixel sizes and fill factors, and these parameters can affect the performance of a {PET} block detector read out by these devices. We compared the performance of block detectors using 4 × 4 Si-{PM} arrays with 25 µm (Hamamatsu S11064-025P) and 50 µm (S11064-050P) pixels combined with the same 15 × 15 matrix {LGSO} block made of 0.7 × 0.7 × 6 mm3 scintillator pixels. Evaluated characteristics include photopeak linearity, energy resolution and positioning performance. Although the photopeak linearity and energy resolution are slightly better for the Si-{PM} with 25 µm pixels, the position performance measured by the separation of the position histogram is significantly better for the Si-{PM} with 50 µm pixels. We conclude that using the Si-{PM} with 50 µm pixels will provide a better solution for the development of ultrahigh-resolution {PET} systems.},

	abstract = {Single photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT}) and positron emission tomography ({PET}) are established medical imaging modalities that have been implemented for decades, but improvements in detector design and camera electronics are needed for advancement of both imaging technologies. Detectors are arguably the most important aspect of the systems. Similar to {SPECT}, {PET} typically relies on indirect conversion of gamma radiation via scintillators coupled with photosensors used to convert optical photons produced by the scintillator into an electrical signal. {PET} detectors are defined by their energy resolution, timing resolution, and spatial resolution, all of which affect and determine the image quality. Improvements in energy resolution have been shown by increasing the brightness of the scintillator utilizing materials like cerium bromide ({CeBr}3) or switching to a direct conversion detector, such as cadmium zinc telluride ({CZT}) or thallium bromide ({TlBr}). Timing resolution for {PET} is a focal point of the current research. Improving the timing resolution improves the signal-to-noise of the {PET} system and is integral to the implementation of time-of-flight {PET}. By utilizing novel configurations, such as side readouts on scintillators, timing resolution has been improved dramatically. Similarly, metascintillators, which use complex combinations for the scintillator material, have also shown improvements to the timing resolution. Additional research has focused on using Cherenkov light emission in scintillators to further improve the timing resolution. Other research is focused on using convolutional neural networks and other signal processing to enhance timing resolution. Lastly, aside from acollinearity and positron range, spatial resolution is impacted by the {PET} detector, therefore improving the intrinsic spatial resolution of the detector will allow for smaller features to be imaged. One method for improving the spatial resolution is to use unique configurations with layered scintillators. Additionally, monolithic scintillators have also been shown to have reduced spatial resolution. The future for both {SPECT} and {PET} image system advancement will depend on continued development of the detectors via many different pathways including materials, signal processing, physics, and novel configurations. In this review article, we will discuss challenges and emerging technologies for state-of-the-art radiation detectors utilized in {PET} and {SPECT}.},

We used measurements on the {PennPET} Explorer (64-cm {AFOV} prototype) and simulations of scanners up to 143-cm long to assess scanner performance with axial gaps introduced by varying the number of detector rows in each ring. Removing detectors reduces the total sensitivity and results in a non-uniform axial noise profile. Axial resolution shows small ({\textless}0.5 mm) loss from the edge of the {AFOV} to the center, even for a 143-cm {AFOV} scanner with an unrestricted acceptance angle. The presence of large axial gaps increases the variability in axial resolution and contrast recovery across the {AFOV} compared to a system without gaps. More modest axial gaps show less variable behavior. The results suggest that designs where the gap is no larger than one-half of the width of a detector ring may be preferred, although the optimal choice of scanner design with the trade-offs of performance and {AFOV} will depend on its intended usage.},

In this proof of principle study, we introduce a sparse ring configuration involving half the original number of rings uniformly spaced across the same axial Field-of-view ({FOV}) and assess its effect on image quality and quantitation in {PET} imaging. The Siemens {PET}/{MR} ({mMR}) system matrix was adopted in our proposed configuration. {mMR} consists of 64 detector rings made of 4×4×20 mm3 {LSO} crystals, and extending over 25.6cm axial Field-of-view ({FOV}). To emulate our sparse rings configuration, counts in sinograms associated with at least one even ring number were zeroed (Sparse-Sinograms). To account for the loss in spatial information, the zeroed sinograms were estimated by linear interpolation in sinogram space (Inter-Sinogram). The {PET} images for the compact, the sparse and the interpolated sparse sinogram data were reconstructed using the {OSEM} algorithm (21 subsets, 5 iterations) provided by the Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction using the original {mMR} system matrix to maintain the same number of slices in all images. We validated our approach for one brain {FDG} {PET}/{MR} dataset in terms of image quality, target-to-background ratio ({TBR}) and contrast-to-noise ratio ({CNR}) scores for different number of {OSEM} iterations. Sparse rings configuration yielded comparable image quality to that of the clinical dataset. {TBR} and {CNR} showed increased error with the number of {OSEM} iterations (8.3\% and 23.6\% respectively at 5 iterations), decreasing to 1.7\% and 5.4\% respectively in the Inter-Sinogram images. {PET} imaging with half the number of original detector rings uniformly spaced over the same axial {FOV}, yielded comparable image quality, yet reduced {TBR} and {CNR}, which may be recovered via linear inter-sinogram interpolation. Uniformly spacing a given set of {PET} detector rings to double their axial {FOV} is possible without significant losses in image quality and quantitation.},

	abstract = {Resolving the depth of interaction ({DOI}) of a {\textbackslash}gamma -photon in the scintillator is necessary to correct for parallax errors in organ-dedicated and large-scale time-of-flight positron emission tomography ({TOF}-{PET}) scanners or enable the precise recovery of Compton-scattered {\textbackslash}gamma -photons. Doubling the number of readout channels and moving toward more complex detector designs are methods to encode {DOI}, often associated with high costs. We propose a {DOI}-capable {TOF}-{PET} detector unit concept confining light-sharing to two detector channels, where the high benefit lies in scalability and the prospect of Compton recovery between adjacent units. We evaluate these scalable, {DOI}-capable unit concepts, realizing {DOI} encoding between two {LYSO}:Ce,Ca crystals ( 3 {\textbackslash}times 3 {\textbackslash}times 20 mm3; Taiwan Applied Crystals) one-to-one coupled to two Broadcom {AFBR}-S4N33C013 silicon-photomultipliers ({SiPMs}) read out with the {TOFPET}2 {ASIC}. The best-performing unit employing a triangular reflector sheet and optical glue between the two crystals and mounted on two {FBK} {NUV}-{MT} {SiPMs} results in a {DOI} resolution of about 3 mm ({RMSE}) based on the energy ratio digitized by the two channels while maintaining a coincidence time resolution ({CTR}) of 226 ps ({FWHM}) with {TOFPET}2 {ASIC} readout, applying a linear {DOI} correction. Using {HF} readout, the {CTR} of the proposed detector unit was improved to 141 ps ({FWHM}).},

	abstract = {In this work we explored the effects of using systematic band patterns of surface roughing to modulate the light transport in a dual-ended readout detector for {PET} imaging that uses 100 mm long {LYSO} crystals oriented in the axial direction. The long surfaces of 3 × 2 × 100 mm3 {LYSO} crystals, initially polished on all sides, were systematically roughed in a band pattern with 0.8 mm bands of roughed surface spaced at 5 mm increments over the central 8 cm of the crystal length. Cases of one to four surfaces of the crystal roughed with this pattern were explored. Two configurations of bands were examined for the opposite surfaces of the crystals: (i) bands created in the same axial location (coinciding bands) and (ii) band locations interleaved (interleaving bands). Each crystal was then wrapped in Teflon and read out at both ends using position sensitive photomultiplier tubes ({PSPMTs}). An electronically collimated 511 {keV} photon beam was oriented perpendicular to the long direction of the crystal and data acquired at discrete locations along the crystal length. The ratio of the two {PMT} signals was used to find the axial position of interaction and axial-positioning resolution in the light sharing direction of the dual-ended readout detector while their sum was used to determine the light output and energy resolution. The axial-positioning resolution corrected for the beam width improved from an average of 8.7 mm {FWHM} with no surface treatment to 5.9, 3.9 or 3.4 mm {FWHM} for coinciding band patterns on one, two or four surfaces, respectively. The banding patterns resulted in degraded energy resolution, with a decrease from 11.1\% {FWHM} for the untreated crystal to 12.0\%, 13.5\% and 13.6\% for the patterns on one, two and four surfaces, respectively. When the axial-positioning resolution is corrected for the beam width, we estimated the best resolution for the case of four banded surfaces to be 3.4 mm {FWHM} in this study. The same axial-positioning resolution was obtained when interleaving bands were created on only two opposite surfaces with a better energy resolution of 12.2\%.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel scintillation detector design for positron emission tomography ({PET}), which has depth of interaction ({DOI}) capability and uses a single-ended readout scheme. The {DOI} detector contains a pair of crystal bars segmented using sub-surface laser engraving ({SSLE}). The two crystal bars are optically coupled to each other at their top segments and are coupled to two photo-sensors at their bottom segments. Initially, we evaluated the performance of different designs of single crystal bars coupled to photomultiplier tubes at both ends. We found that segmentation by {SSLE} results in superior performance compared to the conventional method. As the next step, we constructed a crystal unit composed of a 3 × 3 × 20 mm3 crystal bar pair, with each bar containing four layers segmented using the {SSLE}. We measured the {DOI} performance by changing the optical conditions for the crystal unit. Based on the experimental results, we then assessed the detector performance in terms of the {DOI} capability by evaluating the position error, energy resolution, and light collection efficiency for various crystal unit designs with different bar sizes and a different number of layers (four to seven layers). {DOI} encoding with small position error was achieved for crystal units composed of a 3 × 3 × 20 mm3 {LYSO} bar pair having up to seven layers, and with those composed of a 2 × 2 × 20 mm3 {LYSO} bar pair having up to six layers. The energy resolution of the segment in the seven-layer 3 × 3 × 20 mm3 crystal bar pair was 9.3\%–15.5\% for 662 {keV} gamma-rays, where the segments closer to the photo-sensors provided better energy resolution. {SSLE} provides high geometrical accuracy at low production cost due to the simplicity of the crystal assembly. Therefore, the proposed {DOI} detector is expected to be an attractive choice for practical small-bore {PET} systems dedicated to imaging of the brain, breast, and small animals.},

	abstract = {Depth encoding detectors are preferred for {PET} scanners with a small ring diameter and a long axial field of view. In this work, novel depth encoding detectors using different inter-crystal reflector arrangements along the depth of single layer crystal arrays are proposed and their performance is evaluated. As compared to the previous four-layer detector with different reflector arrangements, the detectors proposed in this work are expected to improve the energy and timing resolution of the detectors. 4×4 {LYSO} arrays with a crystal size of 3×3×20 mm3 and 6×6 {LYSO} arrays with a crystal size of 2×2×20 mm3 are fabricated using two and four reflector arrangements along the crystal’s depth. The {LYSO} arrays are single-ended read out by 4×4 {SiPM} arrays with a pixel size of 3×3 mm2. The first and second half of the crystals are clearly resolved from the flood histograms for the two detectors with two reflector arrangements. 80\% of the events can be correctly assigned to each half. The detectors provide a two layer depth encoding capability. The photopeak value and average energy resolution of the first and second half of the crystal are almost the same. The average crystal energy resolutions of the 4×4 and 6×6 {LYSO} arrays with two reflector arrangements are 10.4\% and 11.6\%, respectively. The timing resolutions of the two detectors are 284 ps and 442 ps for an energy window of 400∼600 {keV}. However, each quarter of the crystals cannot be clearly resolved for the two detectors with four reflector arrangements and further optimization is still required. The detectors developed in this work simultaneously provide a two layer depth encoding capability, good energy and timing resolution, and show great promise for developing high performance dedicated brain, whole body and total body {PET} scanners in the future.},

Current {DOI} detectors, with either single-ended readout design or dual-ended readout design, usually require substantial changes to the crystal arrays and/or readout electronics. In this work, we proposed a single-ended readout {DOI} estimation approach with minimal changes in the detector hardware design, using a supervised machine learning algorithm, random forest ({RF}). The energy value measured from one end of the crystal, combined with sample points of the pulse signal, were used as inputs to the {DOI} estimation algorithm, which provided a {DOI} performance close to that of the dual-ended readout design. We compared the proposed single-ended {RF} method with the classic dual-ended energy ratio method and a dual-ended version of the {RF} method, using positioning error and resolution as performance metrics for {DOI} estimation. All three methods achieved average absolute {DOI} positioning errors of {\textless} 1.00 mm and average {DOI} resolutions of {\textless} 2.20 mm full width at half maximum ({FWHM}). More specifically, we achieved the averaged {DOI} resolutions of 2.15, 1.80, and 1.93 mm {FWHM} for the single-ended {RF} method, dual-ended {RF} method, and dual-ended energy ratio method, respectively. In conclusion, the single-ended {RF} method achieved comparable performance without extra photodetectors and readout electronics and may provide a feasible solution for {DOI} estimation.},

	abstract = {Both monolithic and semi-monolithic scintillator positron emission tomography ({PET}) detectors can measure the depth of interaction with single-ended readout. Usually scintillators with a thickness of 10 mm or less are used since the position resolutions of the detectors degrade as the scintillator thickness increases. In this work, the performance of a 20 mm thick long rectangular semi-monolithic scintillator {PET} detector was measured by using both single-ended and dual-ended readouts with silicon photomultiplier ({SiPM}) arrays to provide a high detection efficiency. The semi-monolithic scintillator detector consists of nine lutetium–yttrium oxyorthosilicate slices measuring 1.37 × 51.2 × 20 mm3 with erythrocyte sedimentation rate foils of 0.065 mm thickness in between the slices. The {SiPM} array at each end of the scintillator detector consists of 16 × 4 {SiPMs} with a pixel size of 3.0 × 3.0 mm2 and a pitch of 3.2 mm. The 64 signals of each {SiPM} array are processed by using the {TOFPET}2 application-specific integrated circuit individually. All but the edge slices can be clearly resolved for the detectors with both single-ended and dual-ended readouts. The single-ended readout detector provides an average full width at half maximum ({FWHM}) Y (continuous direction) position resolution of 2.43 mm, Z (depth direction) position resolution of 4.77 mm, energy resolution of 25.7\% and timing resolution of 779 ps. The dual-ended readout detector significantly improves the Y and Z position resolutions, slightly improves the energy and timing resolution at the cost of two photodetectors required for one detector module and provides an average {FWHM} Y position resolution of 1.97 mm, Z position resolution of 2.60 mm, energy resolution of 21.7\% and timing resolution of 718 ps. The energy and timing resolution of the semi-monolithic scintillator detector in this work are worse than those of the segmented scintillator array detector and need to be further improved. The semi-monolithic scintillator detector described in this work reduces costs as compared to the traditional segmented scintillator array detector and reduces the edge effect as compared to the monolithic scintillator detector.},

	abstract = {Background:
Positron emission tomography ({PET}) has had a transformative impact on oncological and neurological applications. However, still much of {PET}’s potential remains untapped with limitations primarily driven by low spatial resolution which severely hampers accurate quantitative {PET} imaging via the partial volume effect ({PVE}).

Purpose:
We present experimental results of a practical and cost-effective ultra-high resolution brain-dedicated {PET} scanner, using our depth-encoding Prism-{PET} detectors arranged along a compact and conformal gantry, showing substantial reduction in {PVE} and accurate radiotracer uptake quantification in small regions.

Methods:
The decagon-shaped prototype scanner has a long diameter of 38.5 cm, a short diameter of 29.1 cm, and an axial field-of-view ({FOV}) of 25.5 mm with a single ring of 40 Prism-{PET} detector modules. Each module comprises a 16 × 16 array of 1.5 × 1.5 × 20 mm3 lutetium yttrium oxyorthosillicate ({LYSO}) scintillator crystals coupled 4-to-1 to an 8 × 8 array of silicon photomultiplier ({SiPM}) pixels on one end and to a prismatoid light guide array on the opposite end. The scanner’s performance was evaluated by measuring depth-of-interaction ({DOI}) resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, spatial resolution, sensitivity, and image quality of ultra-micro Derenzo and three-dimensional (3D) Hoffman brain phantoms.

Results:
The full width at half maximum ({FWHM}) {DOI}, energy, and timing resolutions of the scanner are 2.85 mm, 12.6\%, and 271 ps, respectively. Not considering artifacts due to mechanical misalignment of detector blocks, the intrinsic spatial resolution is 0.89 mm {FWHM}. Point source images reconstructed with 3D filtered back-projection ({FBP}) show an average spatial resolution of 1.53 mm {FWHM} across the entire {FOV}. The peak absolute sensitivity is 1.2\% for an energy window of 400–650 {keV}. The ultra-micro Derenzo phantom study demonstrates the highest reported spatial resolution performance for a human brain {PET} scanner with perfect reconstruction of 1.00 mm diameter hot-rods. Reconstructed images of customized Hoffman brain phantoms prove that Prism-{PET} enables accurate radiotracer uptake quantification in small brain regions (2–3 mm).

Conclusions:
Prism {PET} will substantially strengthen the utility of quantitative {PET} in neurological disorders, such as early detection of neurodegenerative pathology or improved detection of metastases.},

	abstract = {To detect gamma rays with good spatial, timing and energy resolution while maintaining high sensitivity we need accurate and efficient algorithms to estimate the first gamma interaction position from the measured light distribution. Furthermore, monolithic detectors are investigated as an alternative to pixelated detectors due to increased sensitivity, resolution and intrinsic {DOI} encoding. Monolithic detectors, however, are challenging because of complicated calibration setups and edge effects. In this work, we evaluate the use of neural networks to estimate the 3D first (Compton or photoelectric) interaction position. Using optical simulation data of a 50 × 50 × 16 mm3 {LYSO} crystal, performance is evaluated as a function of network complexity (two to five hidden layers with 64 to 1024 neurons) and amount of training data (1000−8000 training events per calibration position). We identify and address the potential pitfall of overfitting on the training grid through evaluation on intermediate positions that are not in the training set. Additionally, the performance of neural networks is directly compared with nearest neighbour positioning. Optimal performance was achieved with a network containing three hidden layers of 256 neurons trained on 1000 events/position. For more complex networks, the performance degrades at intermediate positions and overfitting starts to occur. A median 3D positioning error of 0.77 mm and a 2D {FWHM} of 0.46 mm is obtained. This is a 17\% improvement in terms of {FWHM} compared to the nearest neighbour algorithm. Evaluation only on events that are not Compton scattered results in a 3D positioning error of 0.40 mm and 2D {FWHM} of 0.42 mm. This reveals that Compton scatter results in a considerable increase of 93\% in positioning error. This study demonstrates that very good spatial resolutions can be achieved with neural networks, superior to nearest neighbour positioning. However, potential overfitting on the training grid should be carefully evaluated.},

	abstract = {Objective. Time-of-flight ({TOF}) and depth-of-interaction ({DOI}) are well recognized as important information to improve {PET} image quality. Since such information types are not correlated, many {TOF}-{DOI} detectors have been developed but there are only a few reports of high-resolution detectors (e.g. 1.5 mm resolution) for brain {PET} systems. Based on the {DOI} detector, which enables single-ended readout by optically coupling a pair of crystals and having a loop structure, we have developed the crosshair light sharing ({CLS}) {PET} detector that optically couples the four-loop structure, consisting of quadrisected crystals comparable in size to a photo-sensor, to four photo-sensors in close proximity arranged in a windmill shape. Even as a high-resolution detector, the {CLS} {PET} detector could obtain both {TOF} and {DOI} information. The coincidence resolving time ({CRT}) of the {CLS} {PET} detector needs to be further improved, however, for application to the brain {PET} system. Recently, a fast {LGSO} crystal was developed which has advantages in detection efficiency and {CRT} compared to the {GFAG} crystal. In this work, we developed the {CLS} {PET} detector using the fast {LGSO} crystal for the {TOF}-{DOI} brain {PET} system. Approach. The crystals were each 1.45 × 1.45 × 15 mm3 and all surfaces were chemically etched. The {CLS} {PET} detector consisted of a 14 × 14 crystal array optically coupled to an 8 × 8 {MPPC} array. Main results. The fast {LGSO} array provided 10.1\% energy resolution at 511 {keV}, 4.7 mm {DOI} resolution at 662 {keV}, and 293 ps {CRT} with the energy window of 440–620 {keV}. Significance. The developed {CLS} {PET} detector has 290\% higher coincidence sensitivity, 30\% better energy resolution, and 32\% better time resolution compared to our previous {CLS} {PET} detector.},

	abstract = {The use of monolithic scintillator-based photon detectors in positron emission tomography ({PET}) has emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional pixelated array designs. Monolithic-based detector designs employ the scintillation light distribution ({LD}) shape to provide a single 3-D photon interaction position per event, enabling high spatial resolution throughout the crystal volume. Since there are no intercrystal gaps, monolithic designs provide higher intrinsic detection efficiency compared to pixelated designs. However, in order to make the monolithic detector design practical for clinical {PET} systems, some major drawbacks need to be addressed, such as the time-consuming and complex calibration procedures to obtain precise spatial and timing information. This article gives a historical review of monolithic-based {PET} detectors, a description of their main advantages and challenges, describes the state-of-the-art, including their use in current commercial system, and ends with a future prospective.},

The crystal elements of one {BGO} array have polished lateral surfaces, while the crystal elements of the other {BGO} array have unpolished lateral surfaces. The two ends of the {BGO} elements are polished. The two {BGO} arrays both have a pitch size of 1.6 mm and thickness of 20 mm, and {BaSO}4 with a thickness of 80 {\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}textm was used as the reflector. Hamamatsu S14161-3050-08 {SiPM} arrays were used as photodetectors. All the measurements were performed at a bias voltage of 41.0 V and a temperature of 23.5 °C. The flood histograms show that all the crystal elements in the two {BGO} arrays were clearly resolved. The detector based on the {BGO} array with polished lateral surfaces provides an energy resolution of 16.9 ± 1.3\%, timing resolution of 3.2 ± 0.2 ns, and depth-of-interaction ({DOI}) resolution of 18.4 ± 2.2 mm. In comparison, the detector based on the {BGO} array with unpolished lateral surfaces provides an energy resolution of 17.7 ± 2.0\%, timing resolution of 3.5 ± 0.3 ns, and {DOI} resolution of 3.2 ± 0.2 mm.},
